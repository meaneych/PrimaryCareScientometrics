Design: Mixed methods study. Setting: A core outcome set for pre-eclampsia was used as an exemplar. Sample: A long list of potential core outcomes was developed by undertaking a systematic review of pre-eclampsia trials and performing a thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews. Methods: Specific methods used to generate long lists of potential core outcomes were evaluated. Results: Different methodological decisions had a substantial impact on the identification of potential core outcomes. Extracting outcomes from published pre-eclampsia trials was an effective way of identifying 48 maternal, eight fetal, 25 neonatal outcomes, and eight patient-reported outcomes. Limiting the extraction of outcomes to primary outcomes or outcomes commonly reported in pre-eclampsia trials reduced the number and diversity of potential core outcomes identified. Thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews ensured an additional five patient reported outcomes and six outcomes related to future child health were identified. Conclusions: Future core outcome set developers should use quantitative and qualitative methods when developing a long list of potential core outcomes.

       "  '(0.627)  There is uncertainty about whether hypoxic injury accompanying donor death from ligature asphyxiation influences renal transplant outcomes, particularly for recipients of kidneys donated after circulatory death (DCD). The UK Registry analysis was undertaken to determine transplant outcomes in recipients of kidneys from donors who died following ligature asphyxiation. From 2003 to 2016, 2.7% (n\\xa0=\\xa0521) of potential organ donors died following ligature asphyxiation (mostly suicide by hanging). Of these, 409 (78.5%) donated kidneys for transplantation (46.9% donation after brain death [DBD] and 53.1% DCD donors) resulting in 650 kidney transplants. Compared to other deceased donors, those dying from ligature asphyxiation were younger, more often male, and had less hypertension. Unadjusted patient and graft survival were superior for recipients of both DBD and DCD kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation, although after adjustment for donor/recipient variables, transplant outcomes were similar. A case\\x96control matched analysis confirmed transplant outcomes for those who received kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation were similar to controls. Although caution is required in interpreting these findings because of potential selection bias, kidneys from donors dying of ligature asphyxiation suffer an additional warm ischemic insult that does not apparently adversely influence transplant outcomes, even for kidneys from DCD donors.',\n",
       "  '(0.601)  High magnitudes and rates of loading have been implicated in the etiology of running-related injuries. Knowledge of kinematic variables that are predictive of kinetic outcomes could inform clinic-based gait retraining programs. Healthy novice female runners ran on a treadmill while 3-dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Kinetic outcomes consisted of vertical impact transient, average vertical loading rate, instantaneous vertical loading rate, and peak braking force. Kinematic outcomes included step length), hip flexion angle at initial contact, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass at initial contact, shank angle at initial contact, and foot strike angle. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the amount of variance in kinetic outcomes explained by kinematic outcomes. A moderate amount of variance in kinetic outcomes (vertical impact transient = 46%, average vertical loading rate = 37%, instantaneous vertical loading rate = 49%, peak braking force = 54%) was explained by several discrete kinematic variables\\x97predominantly speed, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass, foot strike angle, and step length. Hip flexion angle and shank angle did not contribute to any models. Decreasing step length and transitioning from a rearfoot strike may reduce kinetic risk factors for running-related injuries. In contrast, clinical strategies such as modifying shank angle and hip flexion angle would not appear to contribute significantly to the variance of kinetic outcomes after accounting for other variables.',\n",
       "  '(0.579)  Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) contributes to poor birth outcomes, in part through disrupted placental functions, which may be reflected in the placental epigenome. Here we present a meta-analysis of the associations between MSDP and placental DNA methylation (DNAm) and between DNAm and birth outcomes within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium (N = 1700, 344 with MSDP). We identify 443 CpGs that are associated with MSDP, of which 142 associated with birth outcomes, 40 associated with gene expression, and 13 CpGs are associated with all three. Only two CpGs have consistent associations from a prior meta-analysis of cord blood DNAm, demonstrating substantial tissue-specific responses to MSDP. The placental MSDP-associated CpGs are enriched for environmental response genes, growth-factor signaling, and inflammation, which play important roles in placental function. We demonstrate links between placental DNAm, MSDP and poor birth outcomes, which may better inform the mechanisms through which MSDP impacts placental function and fetal growth.',\n",
       "  \"(0.52)  Background: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program provides temporary relief from deportation and work permits for previously undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. DACA faced direct threats under the Trump administration. There is select evidence of the short-term impacts of DACA on population health, including on birth outcomes, but limited understanding of the long-term impacts. Methods: We evaluated the association between DACA program and birth outcomes using California birth certificate data (2009\\x962018) and a difference-in-differences approach to compare post-DACA birth outcomes for likely DACA-eligible mothers to birth outcomes for demographically similar DACA-ineligible mothers. We also separately compared birth outcomes by DACA eligibility status in the first 3 years after DACA passage (2012\\x962015) and in the subsequent 3 years (2015\\x962018)\\xa0- a period characterized by direct threats to the DACA program - as compared to outcomes in the years prior to DACA passage. Results: In the 7 years after its passage, DACA was associated with a\\xa0lower risk of small-for-gestational age (- 0.018, 95% CI: - 0.035, - 0.002) and greater birthweight (45.8 g, 95% CI: 11.9, 79.7) for births to Mexican-origin individuals\\xa0that were billed to Medicaid. Estimates were consistent but of smaller magnitude for other subgroups. Associations between DACA and birth outcomes were attenuated to the null in the period that began with the announcement of the Trump U.S. Presidential campaign\\xa0(2015-2018), although confidence intervals overlapped with estimates from the immediate post-DACA period. Conclusions: These findings suggest weak to modest initial benefits of DACA for select birthweight outcomes during the period immediately following DACA passage for Mexican-born individuals whose births were billed to Medicaid; any benefits were subsequently attenuated to the null. The benefits of DACA for population health may not have been sufficient to counteract the impacts of threats to the program's future and heightened immigration enforcement occurring in parallel over time.\"],\n",
       " ['(0.847)  Objective To compare how smoking was depicted in Hollywood movies before and after an intervention limiting paid product placement for cigarette brands. Design Correlational analysis. Setting/Participants Top box office hits released in the USA primarily between 1988 and 2011 (n=2134). Intervention The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), implemented in 1998. Main outcome measures This study analyses trends for whether or not movies depicted smoking, and among movies with smoking, counts for character smoking scenes and average smoking scene duration. Results There was no detectable trend for any measure prior to the MSA. In 1999, 79% of movies contained smoking, and movies with smoking contained 8 scenes of character smoking, with the average duration of a character smoking scene being 81 s. After the MSA, there were significant negative post-MSA changes (p<0.05) for linear trends in proportion of movies with any smoking (which declined to 41% by 2011) and, in movies with smoking, counts of character smoking scenes (which declined to 4 by 2011). Between 1999 and 2000, there was an immediate and dramatic drop in average length of a character smoking scene, which decreased to 19 s, and remained there for the duration of the study. The probability that the drop of -62.5 (95% CI -55.1 to -70.0) seconds was due to chance was p<10-16. Conclusions This study\\x92s correlational data suggest that restricting payments for tobacco product placement coincided with profound changes in the duration of smoking depictions in movies.',\n",

We conduct a discrete choice experiment to investigate how adult tobacco cigarette smokers' demand for e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes varies by four attributes: (1) whether e-cigarettes are considered healthier than tobacco cigarettes, (2) the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation device, (3) bans on use in public places, and (4) price. We find that adult smokers' demand for e-cigarettes is motivated more by health concerns than by the desire to avoid smoking bans or higher prices. (JEL C35, I12, I18).\",\n",
       "  '(0.748)  Introduction: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. There are efficacious behavioral and pharmacological options for smoking cessation including three FDA approved therapies\\x96nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion. Nevertheless, uptake of smoking cessation treatments continues to be poor and there is a need for novel smoking cessation treatments. Areas covered: This article reviews the biobehavioral basis of nicotine addiction, its implications for smoking cessation treatments, the various neurotransmitter systems involved in nicotine addictive effects, and their potential therapeutic value. Included are discussions around the role of genetic factors in predicting response to pharmacotherapy and what we know about appropriate application of pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for tobacco use disorder. The evidence for harm reduction measures in individuals who are not willing or able to quit smoking is also reviewed. Expert commentary: Many neurotransmitter system targets have been investigated as a result of our understanding of the underlying neurobiology of tobacco use disorder, and there remain important targets that have yet to be fully explored. rTMS or combination therapies are proposed as possible novel strategies to improve smoking cessation.',\n",
       "  '(0.736)  Introduction: There is an absence of evidence regarding the impact of treating tobacco smoking and vaping equivalently in workplace policies. We aimed to describe and compare smoking and vaping policies in acute nonspecialist NHS Trusts (n = 131) and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (n = 131) in England. Methods: We conducted a census of smoking and vaping policies through organizational websites searches and direct requests for information. We recorded whether and where smoking and vaping were permitted. Results: Smoking was prohibited indoors in all organizations. No NHS Trust permitted smoking freely outdoors, in contrast with 60% of HEIs. In 27% of NHS Trusts and 33% of HEIs smoking was permitted in designated areas, while in 73% of NHS Trusts and 8% of HEIs smoking was prohibited anywhere on site. Vaping was prohibited indoors in all NHS Trusts and all but one HEI, but permitted freely outdoors in 18% of NHS Trusts and 75% of HEIs. Vaping was permitted in designated outdoor spaces in 23% of NHS Trusts: 21% had areas shared with smokers; 2% had separate vaping areas. Vaping was permitted in designated outdoor areas in 18% of HEIs, all of which were shared with smokers. Vaping was prohibited anywhere on site in 54% of NHS Trusts and 6% of HEIs. Conclusions: Policies vary considerably in whether vaping and smoking are treated equivalently. Smoking policies in most HEIs should be reviewed to include more effective tobacco control approaches. Evidence is needed on the impact of imposing shared or separate spaces on vapers and smokers. Implications: This report provides a comprehensive review of smoking and vaping policies in two types of organization across England. It highlights key discrepancies between current public health recommendations for vaping and existing workplace policies, which often lead to smokers and vapers sharing spaces. The report identifies the need for evidence on the impact of imposing shared spaces on smokers and vapers to inform workplace policies that maximize public health benefit.',\n",
       "  '(0.715)  Objective To assess whether exposure to movie smoking is associated with cigarette smoking among Argentinian adolescents. Study design A school-based longitudinal study involving 33 secondary schools in Argentina was performed. The sample included 2502 never smokers (average age at entry<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.5<U+2009>years), 1700 (67.9%) of whom completed follow-up surveys 17 months later. Exposure to the top 100 highest-grossing films for each year between 2009 and 2013 was assessed by content-coding films for tobacco and then by asking adolescents whether they had seen each of 50 titles, randomly selected from the larger pool, then parsing exposure into tertiles. Logistic regression models estimated aOR for the following transitions: nonsusceptible to susceptible never smoker, never smoker to ever smoker, and never smoker to current smoking (last 30 days). Results At follow-up, 34.4% of nonsusceptible never smokers became susceptible, 24.1% reported having tried smoking, and 9.4% were current smokers. Most exposure to movie smoking was from US-produced films (average 60.3 minutes compared with only 3.4 minutes from Argentine films). Greater exposure to smoking in movies was significantly associated with increased odds of becoming susceptible (aORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.77, 95% CI 1.30-2.41), of trying smoking (aORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.54, 1.14-2.08), and marginally associated with current smoking (AORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.54, 0.99-2.40). Exposure to smoking in US- or Argentine-produced films had similar associations. Conclusion In Argentina, exposure to smoking in the movies predicted future smoking transitions among early adolescents, with most exposure coming from viewing US movies.'],\n",
       " ['(0.655)  Background: Feasibility studies are often conducted before committing to a randomised controlled trial (RCT), yet there is little published evidence to inform how useful feasibility studies are, especially in terms of adding or reducing waste in research. This study attempted to examine how many feasibility studies demonstrated that the full trial was feasible and whether some feasibility studies were inherently likely to be feasible or not feasible, based on the topic area and/or research setting. Methods: Keyword searches were conducted on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry to identify all completed feasibility studies which had been conducted in the UK. Results: A total of 625 records from the 1933 identified were reviewed before it became evident that it would be futile to continue. Of 329 feasibility studies identified, 160 had a known outcome (49%), 133 (83%) trials were deemed to be feasible and only 27 (17%) were reported to be non-feasible. There were therefore too few studies to allow the intended comparison of differences in non-feasible studies by topic and/or setting. Conclusions: There were too few studies reported as non-feasible to draw any useful conclusions on whether topic and/or setting had an effect. However, the high feasibility rate (83%) may suggest that non-feasible studies are subject to publication bias or that many feasible studies are redundant and may be adding waste to the research pathway.',\n",
       "  '(0.61)  Background: The Health Economics Research Centre (HERC) Database of Mapping Studies was established in 2013, based on a systematic review of studies developing mapping algorithms predicting EQ-5D. The Mapping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards (MAPS) statement was published in 2015 to improve reporting of mapping studies. We aimed to update the systematic review and assess the extent to which recently-published studies mapping condition-specific quality of life or clinical measures to the EQ-5D follow the guidelines published in the MAPS Reporting Statement. Methods: A published systematic review was updated using the original inclusion criteria to include studies published by December 2016. We included studies reporting novel algorithms mapping from any clinical measure or patient-reported quality of life measure to either the EQ-5D-3L or EQ-5D-5L. Titles and abstracts of all identified studies and the full text of papers published in 2016 were assessed against the MAPS checklist. Results: The systematic review identified 144 mapping studies reporting 190 algorithms mapping from 110 different source instruments to EQ-5D. Of the 17 studies published in 2016, nine (53%) had titles that followed the MAPS statement guidance, although only two (12%) had abstracts that fully addressed all MAPS items. When the full text of these papers was assessed against the complete MAPS checklist, only two studies (12%) were found to fulfil or partly fulfil all criteria. Of the 141 papers (across all years) that included abstracts, the items on the MAPS statement checklist that were fulfilled by the largest number of studies comprised having a structured abstract (95%) and describing target instruments (91%) and source instruments (88%). Conclusions: The number of published mapping studies continues to increase. Our updated database provides a convenient way to identify mapping studies for use in cost-utility analysis. Most recent studies do not fully address all items on the MAPS checklist.',\n",
       "  \"(0.572)  Mixed studies reviews include empirical studies with diverse designs (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods). To make the process of identifying relevant empirical studies for such reviews more efficient, we developed a mixed filter that included different keywords and subject headings for quantitative (e.g., cohort study), qualitative (e.g., focus group), and mixed methods studies. It was tested for six journals from three disciplines. We measured precision (proportion of retrieved documents being relevant), sensitivity (proportion of relevant documents retrieved), and specificity (proportion of non-relevant documents not retrieved). Records were coded before applying the filter and compared with retrieved records, and descriptive statistics were performed, suggesting the mixed filter has high sensitivity, but lower precision and specificity (close to 50%). Next, based on the success of the filter, we developed an automated text classification system that can automatically select empirical studies in order to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews. Several algorithms were trained and validated with 8,050 database records that were previously manually categorized.

       "  '(0.544)  This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the associations between obesity and puberty timing based on scientific evidence. Eight electronic databases were searched up to February 2017 for eligible studies, and two reviewers screened the articles and extracted the data independently. A total of 11 cohort studies with 4841 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared with the group of normal-weight girls, the obese group had more girls with menarche (RR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.59-2.19, 2 studies). The number of girls with early puberty was significantly higher in the obese group than the normal weight group (RR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.32-4.52, 5 studies). However, no differences were detected between girls who were obese or normal weight at age of menarche (WMD: -0.53 years, 95% CI: -1.24-0.19, 2 studies). There is no consistent result in the relationship between obesity and timing of pubertal onset in boys. Obesity may contribute to early onset of puberty in girls, while in boys, there is insufficient data. Given the limited number of cohort studies included in this meta-analysis, high-quality studies with strong markers of puberty onset, as well as standardized criteria for defining obesity are needed.',\n",
       "  '(0.535)  Rationale for the review: Air travel may be associated with viruses spread via infected passengers and potentially through in-flight transmission. Given the novelty of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on transmission dynamics of other respiratory viruses. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft, report policy implications and to highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention. Methods: We searched four electronic databases (1 February 2020-27 January 2021) and included studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings. Key findings: We included 18 studies on in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission (130 unique flights) and 2 studies on wastewater from aircraft. The quality of evidence from most published studies was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive samples with high cycle threshold values (33-39). Index case definition was heterogeneous across studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68 to 100%. Authors traced 2800/19 729 passengers, 140/180 crew members and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. Three studies, each investigating one flight, reported no secondary cases. Secondary attack rate among studies following up >80% of passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0 and 8.2%. The studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Two studies performed viral cultures with 10 positive results. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of likelihood and extent. The variation in design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting future studies of transmission on aircraft should be developed.'],\n",
       " ['(0.519)  We aimed to compare 30-day readmission after medical-surgical hospitalization for people who experience imprisonment and matched people in the general population in Ontario, Canada. We used linked population-based correctional and health administrative data. Of people released from Ontario prisons in 2010, we identified those with at least one medical or surgical hospitalization between 2005 and 2015 while they were in prison or within 6 months after release. For those with multiple eligible hospitalizations, we randomly selected one hospitalization. We stratified people by whether they were in prison or recently released from prison at the time of hospital discharge. We matched each person with a person in the general population based on age, sex, hospitalization case mix group, and hospital discharge year. Our primary outcome was 30-day hospital readmission. We included 262 hospitalizations for people in prison and 1,268 hospitalizations for people recently released from prison. Readmission rates were 7.7% (95%CI 4.4-10.9) for people in prison and 6.9% (95% CI 5.5-8.3) for people recently released from prison. Compared with matched people in the general population, the unadjusted HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.41-1.27) for people in prison and 0.78 (95%CI 0.60-1.02) for people recently released from prison. Adjusted for baseline morbidity and social status, hospitalization characteristics, and post-discharge health care use, the HR for 30-day readmission was 0.74 (95%CI 0.40-1.37) for people in prison and 0.48 (95%CI 0.36-0.63) for people recently released from prison. In conclusion, people recently released from prison had relatively low rates of readmission. Research is needed to elucidate reasons for lower readmission to ensure care quality and access.',\n",
       "  '(0.511)  We are a team of academic researchers, people with learning disabilities and carers. We worked together to design training materials for people with learning disabilities and carers to work as co-researchers on research projects. The training was for doing a type of research called ethnography. When you do ethnography, you spend time with people to learn about their lives. In this article, we describe what we did and what we learnt. We think more people with learning disabilities and carers should be involved in research but many do not have the confidence to do it. Training can help with that. We also think that ethnography is a type of research that can be easier to do than other types of research. This is because ethnography uses the skills lots of us already have the following: watching, listening and talking to people. Abstract: Background: There is a strong ethical case and an urgent need for more participatory research practices in disability research but a lack of resources to support this. It is important to involve people with learning disabilities and carers at all stages, including when designing training for co-research. Methods: We co-developed training materials to support people with learning disabilities and carers to work as ethnographic co-researchers and for academic researchers to facilitate co-research. We focused on what people with learning disabilities and carers thought was important to learn. Findings: Whilst not all types of research methods are easy to democratise, ethnographic observation is a research method that lends itself well to participatory co-research. Conclusions: For people to be able to meaningfully participate, research processes need to become more accessible and transparent. Training that considers the needs and priorities of people with learning disabilities and carers and addresses the confidence gap is key for meaningful co-research.',\n",
       "  '(0.478)  Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) has become increasingly prevalent worldwide, this study investigated the associations of SUD and alcohol, cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use disorder with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 11 major CVD subtypes. Methods: This study was based on a 20% random sample of residents in British Columbia, Canada, who were aged 18 <U+02D7> 80 years at baseline on January 1, 2015. Using linked administrative health data during 2010 <U+02D7> 2014, we identified people with various SUDs and prevalent CVDs at baseline, and examined the cross-sectional associations between SUDs and CVDs. After excluding people with CVDs at baseline, we followed the cohort for 4 years to identify people who developed incident CVDs, and examined the longitudinal associations between SUDs and CVDs. Results: The cross-sectional analysis at baseline included 778,771 people (mean age 45 years, 50% male), 13,279 (1.7%) had SUD, and 41,573 (5.3%) had prevalent CVD. After adjusting for covariates, people with SUD were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 <U+02D7> 2.8) times more likely than people without SUD to have prevalent CVD. The longitudinal analysis included 617,863 people, 17,360 (2.8%) developed incident CVD during the follow-up period. After adjusting for covariates, people with SUD were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6 <U+02D7> 1.9) times more likely than people without SUD to develop incident CVD. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were more pronounced for people with opioid or stimulant use disorder. Conclusions: People with SUD are more likely to have prevalent CVD and develop incident CVD compared with people without SUD.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted surveys with clients of the Unlocking the Gates Peer Health Mentoring program on their release. The authors compared the characteristics of people who had and had not heard of the GSDOA and who were in possession of a THN kit. Findings: In this study, 71% people had heard of the GSDOA, and 55.6% were in possession of a THN kit. This study found that 99% of people who had heard of the GSDOA indicated that they would call 911 if they saw an overdose. Among people who perceived themselves to be at risk of overdose, 28.3% did not have a THN kit. Only half (52%) of participants had a mobile phone, but 100% of those with a phone said they would call 911 if they witnessed an overdose. Originality/value: The authors found that people with knowledge of the GSDOA were likely to report that they would call 911 for help with an overdose. Education about the GSDOA should be a standard component of naloxone training in correctional facilities. More than one in four people at risk of overdose were released without a naloxone kit, highlighting opportunities for training and distribution. Access to a cellphone is important in enabling calls to 911 and should be included in discharge planning.',\n",

Data were obtained from MyVoice, a weekly text messaging survey of youth aged 14\\x9624 years. Youth were recruited nationally at community events and online; Southeast Michigan was overrepresented. Mixed methods analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology. The majority of respondents (n = 683) were white (71.4%) and had education beyond high school (56.5%). Most (79%) stated that bathroom use by transgender people should not be restricted, rationalizing: 1) bathroom use is private and should be a personal decision; 2) choosing bathrooms is a matter of equality, freedom, and human rights; 3) transgender people are not sexual perpetrators; and 4) forcing transgender people to use particular bathrooms puts them at risk. Contrary to the current policy in many schools, respondents do not support restrictions on bathroom use by transgender people.'],\n",
       " ['(0.602)  By mid-2019 there were more than 80 AI ethics guides available in the public domain. Despite this, 2020 saw numerous news stories break related to ethically questionable uses of AI. In part, this is because AI ethics theory remains highly abstract, and of limited practical applicability to those actually responsible for designing algorithms and AI systems. Our previous research sought to start closing this gap between the \\x91what\\x92 and the \\x91how\\x92 of AI ethics through the creation of a searchable typology of tools and methods designed to translate between the five most common AI ethics principles and implementable design practices. Whilst a useful starting point, that research rested on the assumption that all AI practitioners are aware of the ethical implications of AI, understand their importance, and are actively seeking to respond to them. In reality, it is unclear whether this is the case. It is this limitation that we seek to overcome here by conducting a mixed-methods qualitative analysis to answer the following four questions: what do AI practitioners understand about the need to translate ethical principles into practice? What motivates AI practitioners to embed ethical principles into design practices? What barriers do AI practitioners face when attempting to translate ethical principles into practice? And finally, what assistance do AI practitioners want and need when translating ethical principles into practice?',\n",
       "  '(0.599)  Background: Hospital medicine has grown as a field. However, no study has examined trends in career choices by internists over the past decade. Objective: To measure changes in practice setting for general internists. Design: Using Medicare fee-for-service claims (2008 to 2018) and data from the American Board of Internal Medicine, practice setting types were measured annually for general internists initially certifying between 1990 and 2017. Setting: General internists (non-subspecializing) treating Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Patients: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with at least 20 evaluation and management (E&M) visits annually. Measurements: Practice setting types were defined as hospitalist (>95% inpatient E&M), outpatient only (100% outpatient E&M), or mixed. Results: 67 902 general internists, comprising 80% of all general internists initially certified from 1990 to 2017 (n= 84 581), were studied. From 2008 to 2018, both hospitalists and outpatientonly physicians increased as percentages of general internists (25% to 40% and 23% to 38%, respectively). This was accompanied by a 56% decline in the percentage of mixed-practice physicians (52% to 23%) as these physicians largely migrated to outpatient-only practice. By 2018, 71% of newly certified general internists practiced as hospitalists compared with only 8% practicing as outpatient-only physicians. Most (86% of hospitalists in 2013) had the same practice type 5 years later. This retention rate was similar across early career and more senior physicians (86% and 85% for the 1999 and 2012 initial certification cohorts, respectively) and for the outpatient-only practice type (95%) but was only 57% for the mixed practice type. Limitation: Practice setting measurement relied only on 7Medicare fee-for-service claims. Conclusion: Newly certified general internists are largely choosing hospital medicine as their career choice whereas more senior physicians increasingly see patients only in the outpatient setting.',\n",
       "  '(0.546)  Background: Return-of-service (ROS) agreements require international medical graduates (IMGs) who accept medical residency positions in Canada to practice in specified geographic areas following completion of training. However, few studies have examined how ROS agreements influence career decisions. We examined IMG resident and early-career family physicians\\x92 perceptions of the residency matching process, ROS requirements, and how these factors shaped their early career decisions. Methods: As part of a larger project, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with early-career family physicians and family medicine residents in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia. We asked participants about their actual or intended practice characteristics (e.g., payment model, practice location) and factors shaping actual or intended practice (e.g., personal/professional influences, training experiences, policy environments). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis approach was employed to identify recurring patterns and themes. Results: For this study, we examined interview data from nine residents and 15 early-career physicians with ROS agreements. We identified three themes: IMGs strategically chose family medicine to increase the likelihood of obtaining a residency position; ROS agreements limited career choices; and ROS agreements delayed preferred practice choice (e.g., scope of practice and location) of an IMGs\\x92 early-career practice. Conclusions: The obligatory nature of ROS agreements influences IMG early-career choices, as they necessitate strategically tailoring practice intentions towards available residency positions. Existing analyses of IMGs\\x92 early-career practice choices neglect to distinguish between ROS and practice choices made independently of ROS requirements. Further research is needed to understand how ROS influences longer term practice patterns of IMGs in Canada.',\n",
       "  \"(0.542)  BACKGROUND: The province of British Columbia is facing a family physician shortage despite consistent increases in the number of physicians per capita and ongoing reforms to address the shortage. We identify physicians' priorities for structural reform, describe the alignment of those priorities with BC's suite of reforms and compare responses between established physicians and those new to practice; we also assessed rates of burnout. METHODS: All family physicians credentialed within Vancouver Coastal Health in 2018 were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Respondents were asked about their practice model and characteristics, demographics, level of burnout and reform priorities. We used <U+03C7>2 tests and multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations between personal and practice characteristics, burnout and reform priorities. RESULTS: Of the 1017 family physicians invited to participate, 525 (51.6%) responded. Of these, 399 (76.0%) indicated a need for fundamental change to how primary care is delivered; 244 (46.4%) would prefer to be a clinic employee rather than a small business owner. Other reform priorities included options to practise in a team (stated as very important by 69.6% of respondents), direct funding for team roles (66.7%), direct clinic funding (59.8%), part-time work options (64.7%), and ability to take planned vacations and parental leave (81.1%). The importance of individual reform priorities varied based on the participants' model of practice, location and years in practice. Of respondents, 108 (21.1%) had experienced a high level of burnout. INTERPRETATION: Almost half of family physicians would prefer to be employees rather than small business owners and over 20% reported a high level of burnout. Practice models offering direct employment model have very limited availability and are not included in the current suite of reforms in BC, potentially pulling physicians away from community-based family medicine and into other models or specialties.\",\n",
       "  '(0.54)  Background Focused practice within family medicine may be increasing globally, but there is limited research on the factors contributing to decisions to focus practice. Aim To examine the factors influencing resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice across three Canadian provinces. Design and setting A subset of qualitative interview data were analysed from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, Canada. Method Included in the analysis were a total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practise in a focused area. Comparisons were made for participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice, while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice. Results Three key themes were identified of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current structure of the healthcare system; support from colleagues; and training experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included: alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice. Conclusion Both groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the healthcare system. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces. More research is needed to understand the implications of resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice within the physician workforce.'],\n",

Methods: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of articles published from 01/01/2000 to 01/07/2017. Results: We included 23 studies. Immediately after provision of risk information 87% of individuals were able to recall the absolute risk estimate. Less than half believed that to be their risk, with up to 71% believing their risk to be higher than the estimate. Provision of risk information increased accuracy of perceived absolute risk immediately after risk information compared with no information (pooled RR 4.16 (95%CI 1.28\\x9613.49), 3 studies). There was no significant effect on comparative risk accuracy (pooled RR 1.39 (0.72\\x962.69), 2 studies) and either no change or a reduction in cancer worry, anxiety and fear. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complex cognitive processes involved in the conceptualisation of risk. Practice implications: Individuals who appear to understand and are able to recall risk information most likely do not believe it reflects their own risk.',\n",

Accurate perception of depression risk may play an important role in health behavior change and prevention of depression. However, the way in which people in the community perceive their risk of developing depression is currently unknown. Methods: We analyzed the baseline data from a randomized controlled trial in 358 men and 356 women who are at high risk of having a major depressive episode (MDE). The predicted risk was assessed by sex-specific multivariable risk predictive algorithms for MDE. We compared participants\\x92 perceived risk and their predicted risk. Accurate risk perception was defined as perceived risk is in the range of predicted risk ± 10%. Results: In men, 29.7% perceived their risk accurately; 47.5% overestimated their risk; 22.8% underestimated their risk. In women, the proportions were 21.7%, 59.6% and 18.7%, respectively. Compared to men, women were more likely to overestimate their risk and less likely to be accurate. Regression modeling revealed that poor self-rated health and higher predicted depression risk were associated with inaccuracy of risk perception in men; a family history of MDE, higher psychological distress and lower predicted risk were associated with inaccuracy of risk perception in women. Conclusions: Individuals who are at high risk of developing depression tend to overestimate their risk, especially women. Inaccurate depression risk perception is related to people's health status. Educational interventions are needed to enhance the accuracy of risk perception to encourage positive behavior change and uptake of preventive strategies.\",\n",
       "  '(0.545)  Alzheimer\\x92s disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality in the elderly. While the coding change of APOE-e4 is a key risk factor for late-onset AD and has been believed to be the only risk factor in the APOE locus, it does not fully explain the risk effect conferred by the locus. Here, we report the identification of AD causal variants in PVRL2 and APOC1 regions in proximity to APOE and define common risk haplotypes independent of APOE-e4 coding change. These risk haplotypes are associated with changes of AD-related endophenotypes including cognitive performance, and altered expression of APOE and its nearby genes in the human brain and blood. High-throughput genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis further supports the roles of these risk haplotypes in modulating chromatin states and gene expression in the brain. Our findings provide compelling evidence for additional risk factors in the APOE locus that contribute to AD pathogenesis.',\n",

Additionally, we aimed to explore what factors are associated with underestimation and overestimation immediately post-intervention. Methods Cohort study based on the data collected in the Diabetes Risk Communication Trial. We included 379 participants (mean age 48.9 (SD 7.4) years; 55.1% women) who received a genotypic or phenotypic risk estimate for T2D. Results While only 1.3% of participants perceived their risk accurately at baseline, this increased to 24.7% immediately after receiving a risk estimate and then dropped to 7.3% at eight weeks. Those who overestimated their risk at baseline continued to overestimate it, whereas those who underestimated their risk at baseline improved their risk accuracy. We did not identify any other characteristics associated with underestimation or overestimation immediately after receiving a risk estimate. Conclusion Understanding a received risk estimate is challenging for most participants with many continuing to have inaccurate risk perception after receiving the estimate. Practice implications Individuals who overestimate or underestimate their T2D risk before receiving risk information might require different approaches for altering their risk perception.',\n",

We conducted 2 multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses: 1 analysis limited to the immigrant cohort assessing potential risk factors for developing MS, and 1 analysis comparing MS risk between immigrants and matched long-term residents (1:3 match).ResultsWe identified 2,304,302 immigrants for the immigrant-only analysis, of whom 1,526 (0.066%) developed MS. Risk was greatest in those <15 years old at landing (referent <15 years; 16-30 years: hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.85; 31-45 years: HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.47-0.64). Immigrants from the Middle East (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.40) were at greater MS risk than immigrants from Western nations; all other regions had lower risk (p < 0.0001). The matched analysis included 2,207,751 immigrants and 6,362,169 long-term residents. Immigrants were less likely to develop MS than long-term residents (p < 0.0001), although this lower risk was attenuated with longer residence in Canada.ConclusionsMS incidence in immigrants to Ontario, Canada, varied widely by region of origin, with greatest risk seen in those from the Middle East. Longer residence in Canada was associated with increased risk, even with migration in adulthood, suggesting that environmental exposures into adulthood contribute to MS risk.'],\n",

MHT and masked uncontrolled hypertension were defined using office BP and awake BP alone and awake, asleep, or 24-h BP. LVH was assessed by echocardiography.Results:Among participants without high office BP not taking antihypertensive medication, the prevalence of MHT defined by the JNC7 guideline and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline was 25.0 and 33.5% using awake BP only and 37.1 and 52.0% when using awake, asleep, or 24-h BP. The adjusted prevalence ratios for LVH associated with MHT versus sustained normotension defined by the JNC7 and 2017 ACC/AHA BP guidelines were 1.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-2.64] and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.97-2.51), respectively, when using awake BP only and 2.16 (95% CI: 1.36-3.44) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.58-1.82), respectively, when using awake, asleep or 24-h BP. There was no evidence that masked uncontrolled hypertension was associated with LVH when defined using the BP thresholds in either the JNC7 or the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.Conclusion:The association of MHT with LVH may depend on the BP thresholds used.',\n",
       "  '(0.68)  The 2011 NICE hypertension guideline (CG127) undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure (BP) assessment methods to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. The guideline also undertook a cost\\x96utility analysis exploring the cost-effectiveness of the monitoring methods. A new systematic review was undertaken as part of the 2019 NICE hypertension guideline update (NG136). BP monitoring methods compared included Ambulatory BP, Clinic BP and Home BP. Ambulatory BP was the reference standard. The economic model from the 2011 guideline was updated with this new accuracy data. Home BP was more sensitive and specific than Clinic BP. Specificity improved more than sensitivity since the 2011 review. A higher specificity translates into fewer people requiring unnecessary treatment. A key interest was to compare Home BP and Ambulatory BP, and whether any improvement in Home BP accuracy would change the model results. Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in all age and sex subgroups. In all subgroups, Ambulatory BP was associated with lower costs than Clinic BP and Home BP. In all except one subgroup (females aged 40), Ambulatory BP was dominant. However, Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in 40-year-old females as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Home BP versus Ambulatory BP was above the NICE £20,000 threshold. The new systematic review showed that the accuracy of both Clinic BP and Home BP has increased. However, Ambulatory BP remains the most cost-effective option to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension in all subgroups evaluated.',\n",
       "  '(0.647)  The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk. In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents. Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements.',\n",
       "  '(0.637)  Most guidelines have recommended lower home blood pressure (BP) threshold when clinic BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg is used for diagnosis of hypertension. However, home BP thresholds to define hypertension have never been determined in the general population in the United States. We identified home BP thresholds for stage 1 (BP =130/80 mm Hg) hypertension using a regression-based approach in the DHS (Dallas Heart Study; n=5768) and the NCMH study (North Carolina Masked Hypertension; n=420). Home BP thresholds were also assessed using outcome-derived approach based on the composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in the DHS cohort. For this approach, BP thresholds were identified only for systolic BP because diastolic BP was not associated with the outcome. Among untreated participants, the regression-derived thresholds for home BP corresponding to clinic BP for stage 1 hypertension were 129/80 mm Hg in blacks, 130/80 mm Hg in whites, and 126/78 mm Hg in Hispanics, respectively. The results are similar in the North Carolina cohort. The 11-year composite cardiovascular and mortality events corresponding to clinic systolic BP >130 mm Hg were higher in blacks than in whites and Hispanics (13.3% versus 5.98% versus 5.52%, respectively). Using a race/ethnicity-specific composite outcome in the untreated DHS participants, the outcome-derived home systolic BP thresholds corresponding to stage 1 hypertension were 130 mm Hg in blacks, 129 mm Hg in whites, and 131 mm Hg in Hispanics, respectively.

       "  '(0.595)  The Lancet Commission on Hypertension identified that a key action to address the worldwide burden of high blood pressure (BP) was to improve the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy. Currently, there are over 3000 commercially available BP devices, but many do not have published data on accuracy testing according to established scientific standards. This problem is enabled through weak or absent regulations that allow clearance of devices for commercial use without formal validation. In addition, new BP technologies have emerged (e.g. cuffless sensors) for which there is no scientific consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards. Altogether, these issues contribute to the widespread availability of clinic and home BP devices with limited or uncertain accuracy, leading to inappropriate hypertension diagnosis, management and drug treatment on a global scale. The most significant problems relating to the accuracy of BP devices can be resolved by the regulatory requirement for mandatory independent validation of BP devices according to the universally-accepted International Organisation for Standardization Standard. This is a primary recommendation for which there is an urgent international need. Other key recommendations are development of validation standards specifically for new BP technologies and online lists of accurate devices that are accessible to consumers and health professionals. Recommendations are aligned with WHO policies on medical devices and universal healthcare. Adherence to recommendations would increase the global availability of accurate BP devices and result in better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, thus decreasing the worldwide burden from high BP.'],\n",

DMT treatment is a preference-sensitive decision in which shared decision making is indicated. METHODS We used qualitative methods to explore usability of MS decision aids in people aged 18 to 70 years diagnosed with MS. Semistructured interviews aimed to assess patients' overall reaction to using the decision aids. This included specific aspects of the user experience to improve readability, format, content, and patient opinions about whether the integration of the decision aids into visits with MS clinicians would be feasible and assist with making better DMT selections. RESULTS Twenty-three interviews were completed with eligible patients with MS aged 18 to 70 years to improve readability. Using thematic analysis, 5 themes emerged from the analysis including decision aids are easy and understandable, include cost, prioritize side effects and tests, increase font size, and have a simpler injectable grid. We also identified areas for improvement including formatting, side effects of DMT options, transparency of data sources, research, and development. CONCLUSION Overall findings suggest that the decision aids are usable, easy to understand, and helpful to facilitate shared decision making for DMT selection. This work will help guide further modifications to the prototype MS decision aids before publication and can inform the growing body of knowledge regarding the development of high-quality decision aids.\",\n",
       "  '(0.543)  Background Upon admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), all patients should discuss their goals of care and express their wishes concerning life-sustaining interventions (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)). Without such discussions, interventions that prolong life at the cost of decreasing its quality may be used without appropriate guidance from patients. Objectives To adapt an existing decision aid about CPR to create a wiki-based decision aid individually adapted to each patient\\x92s risk factors; and to document the use of a wiki platform for this purpose. Methods We conducted three weeks of ethnographic observation in our ICU to observe intensivists and patients discussing goals of care and to identify their needs regarding decision making. We interviewed intensivists individually. Then we conducted three rounds of rapid prototyping involving 15 patients and 11 health professionals. We recorded and analyzed all discussions, interviews and comments, and collected sociodemographic data. Using a wiki, a website that allows multiple users to contribute or edit content, we adapted the decision aid accordingly and added the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) prediction rule calculator. Results We added discussion of invasive mechanical ventilation. The final decision aid comprises values clarification, risks and benefits of CPR and invasive mechanical ventilation, statistics about CPR, and a synthesis section. We added the GO-FAR prediction calculator as an online adjunct to the decision aid. Although three rounds of rapid prototyping simplified the information in the decision aid, 60% (n = 3/5) of the patients involved in the last cycle still did not understand its purpose. Conclusions Wikis and user-centered design can be used to adapt decision aids to users\\x92 needs and local contexts. Our wiki platform allows other centers to adapt our tools, reducing duplication and accelerating scale-up. Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of care and in using the decision aid. A video version of the decision aid could clarify its purpose.',\n",

Objectives To report on seniors\\x92 and caregivers\\x92 experiences of housing decisions. Design A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach supplemented by qualitative data. Setting Sixteen health jurisdictions providing home care services, Quebec province, Canada. Participants Two separate samples of seniors aged 65 years and informal caregivers of cognitively impaired seniors who had made a decision about housing. Measurements Information on preferred choice and actual choice about housing, role assumed in the decision, decisional conflict and decision regret was obtained through closed-ended questionnaires. Research assistants paraphrased participants\\x92 narratives about their decision-making experiences and made other observations in standardized logbooks. Results Thirty-one seniors (median age: 85.5 years) and 48 caregivers (median age: 65.1 years) were recruited. Both seniors and caregivers preferred that the senior stay at home (64.5% and 71.7% respectively). Staying home was the actual choice for only 32.2% of participating seniors and 36.2% of the seniors cared for by the participating caregivers. Overall, 93% seniors and 71% caregivers reported taking an active or collaborative role in the decision-making process. The median decisional conflict score was 23/100 for seniors and 30/100 for caregivers. The median decision regret score was the same for both (10/100). Qualitative analysis revealed that the housing decision was influenced by factors such as seniors\\x92 health and safety concerns and caregivers\\x92 burden of care. Some caregivers felt sad and guilty when the decision did not match the senior\\x92s preference. Conclusion The actual housing decision made for seniors frequently did not match their preferred housing option.

Using shared decision making in clinical consultations may help to reduce the overuse of options that are not beneficial and to increase use of care supported by evidence.

Objective: The objective of this study was to create a consensus among Canadian mild traumatic brain injury and emergency medicine experts on modifications required to adapt two American decision aids about head CT use for adult and paediatric mild traumatic brain injury to the Canadian context. Methods: We invited 21 Canadian stakeholders and the two authors of the American decision aids to a Nominal Group Technique consensus meeting to generate suggestions for adapting the decision aids. This method encourages idea generation and sharing between team members. Each idea was discussed and then prioritised using a voting system. We collected data using videotaping, writing material and online collaborative writing tools. The modifications proposed were analysed using a qualitative thematic content analysis. Results: Twenty-one participants took part in the meeting, including researchers and clinician researchers (n = 9; 43%), patient partners (n = 3; 14%) and decision makers (n = 2; 10%). A total of 84 ideas were generated. Participants highlighted the need to clarify the purpose of the decision aids, the nature of the problem being addressed and the target population. The tools require sociocultural adaptations, better identification of their target population, better description of head CT utility, advantages and related risks, modification of the visual and written representation of the risk of brain injury and head CT use, and locally adapted, patient follow-up plans. Conclusions: This study based on a Nominal Group Technique identified several adaptations for two American decision aids about head CT use for mild traumatic brain injury to support their use in Canada\\x92s different healthcare, social, cultural and legal context. These adaptations concerned the target users of the decision aids, the information presented, and how the benefits and risks were communicated in the decision aids.

Many patient groups receive grants from pharmaceutical companies that make products being considered for funding. This research examines whether there is an association between the positions that Canadian groups take about the products and conflicts of interest with the companies. Methods The Common Drug Review (CDR) and panCanadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) make recommendations to Canadian provincial and federal drug plans about funding particular drug-indications. Both utilize input from patient groups in making their recommendations. Patient group submissions are available from both organizations and these submissions contain statements about conflicts of interest. Views of the patient groups, with and without a conflict with the company making the drug under consideration and without any conflicts at all, were assessed and then compared with the recommendations from CDR and pCODR. Results There was a total of 222 reports for drug-indications. There were 372 submissions from 93 different patient groups. Groups declared a total of 1896 conflicts with drug companies in 324 (87.1%) individual submissions. There were 268 submissions where groups declared a conflict with the company making the product or said they had no conflict. Irrespective of whether there was a conflict, the views of patient groups about the drug-indications under consideration were the same. There was no statistically significant difference between views of patient groups and the recommendations from CDR and/or pCODR. Conclusions The large majority of patient groups making submissions about funding of particular drug-indications had conflicts with the companies making the products and their views about the products were almost always positive. This association between funding and views needs to be further investigated to determine if a true cause and effect exists.',\n",
       "  '(0.488)  Introduction: Emerging policy consensus advocates that patient-centered care should include an active, practice-level patient role, but it is unknown how commonly these roles are implemented. We sought to understand current prevalence and predictors of practice-level patient engagement in US primary care settings. Methods: We assessed practice-level patient engagement by using 2016 American Board of Family Medicine Certification Examination registration data, restricted to ambulatory primary care site respondents randomly selected for a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) question module. Multivariate logistic regression models identified predictors of high-intensity patient engagement, defined as a patient advisory council or patient volunteers in quality improvement activities. Results: A total of 6900 examinees reported practicing in primary care sites; 1368 randomly received PCMH questions. Practice-level patient engagement included patient surveys (76.5%; 95% CI, 74.3\\x9678.8%), patient suggestion boxes (52.9%; 95% CI, 50.2\\x9655.5%), patient board of director memberships (18.8%; 95% CI, 16.7\\x9620.9%), patient advisory councils (23.8%; 95% CI, 21.5\\x9626.0%), and patient participation in quality improvement (20.5%; 95% CI, 18.3\\x9622.6%). High-intensity patient engagement was reported by 31.1% (95% CI, 28.7\\x9633.6%); predictors included large practice size (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.96 \\x965.57), serving more vulnerable patient populations, (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.18 \\x962.84) and PCMH certification (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.62\\x962.97). Conclusions: Nearly one-third of physicians reported working in settings with high-intensity practice-level patient engagement. An implementation science approach should examine why high-intensity activities are more common in some practice settings and whether these activities add value through improved patient experience and health outcomes.',\n",

This research shows the process by which patients move through this continuum and effectively engage within redesign projects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors studied members of redesign teams, consisting of 5\\x9610 members: clinicians, systems engineers, health system staff and patient(s), from three health systems working on separate projects in a patient safety learning lab. Weekly team meetings were observed, January 2016\\x96April 2018, 17 semi-structured interviews were conducted and findings through a patient focus group were refined. Grounded theory was used to analyze field notes and transcripts. Findings: Results show how the social identity process enables patients to move through stages in a patient engagement continuum (informant, partner and active change agent). Initially, patient and team member perceptions of the patient's role influence their respective behaviors (activating, directing, framing and sharing). Subsequently, patient and team member behaviors influence patient contributions on the team, which can redefine patient and team member perceptions of the patient's role. Originality/value: As health systems grow increasingly complex and become more interested in responding to patient expectations, understanding how to effectively engage patients on redesign teams gains importance. This research investigates how and why patient engagement on redesign teams changes over time and what makes different types of patient roles valuable for team objectives. Findings have implications for how redesign teams can better prepare, anticipate and support the changing role of engaged patients.\"],\n",
       " ['(0.607)  Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.',\n",
       "  '(0.521)  Introduction: Biologics are currently protected from competition by eight years of data protection. The renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) increases data protection from 8 to 10 years. This study investigates the effect of such an extension on drug spending in Canada. Methods: A list of currently available biologics eligible for data protection along with their 2017 sales was compiled. Two years were added to the current expiration date of data protection to see if it exceeded patent protection, and any theoretical change in spending due to delayed competition was calculated. The number of biologics approved after January 1, 1995, that have competition and the time until competition started was analyzed. Theoretical competition due to increased data protection for biologics where data protection has already expired was examined. Results: Depending on how much of the market is captured by biologic competitors and how strong the patents are, lost savings from data protection extension could range from $0 to $305.8 million. One biologic competitor currently on the market could theoretically have been affected by an increase in data protection. Increased data protection would have had minor effects on products that have already lost data protection. Discussion: The potential impact on drug expenditures of a two-year extension in data protection is highly variable. Possible increases in spending on biologics strengthen the rationale for a national pharmacare plan where monopsony buying power would help to control drug prices overall and offset increased spending on biologics.',\n",

       "  '(0.487)  The use of deep learning is becoming increasingly important in the analysis of medical data such as pattern recognition for classification. The use of primary healthcare computational medical records (CMR) data is vital in prediction of infection prevalence across a population, and decision making at a national scale. To date, the application of machine learning algorithms to CMR data remains under-utilized despite the potential impact for use in diagnostics or prevention of epidemics such as outbreaks of influenza. A particular challenge in epidemiology is how to differentiate incident cases from those that are follow-ups for the same condition. Furthermore, the CMR data are typically heterogeneous, noisy, high dimensional and incomplete, making automated analysis difficult. We introduce a methodology for converting heterogeneous data such that it is compatible with a deep autoencoder for reduction of CMR data. This approach provides a tool for real time visualization of these high dimensional data, revealing previously unknown dependencies and clusters. Our unsupervised nonlinear reduction method can be used to identify the features driving the formation of these clusters that can aid decision making in healthcare applications. The results in this work demonstrate that our methods can cluster more than 97.84% of the data (clusters >5 points) each of which is uniquely described by three attributes in the data: Clinical System (CMR system), Read Code (as recorded) and Read Term (standardized coding). Further, we propose the use of Shannon Entropy as a means to analyse the dispersion of clusters and the contribution from the underlying attributes to gain further insight from the data. Our results demonstrate that Shannon Entropy is a useful metric for analysing both the low dimensional clusters of CMR data, and also the features in the original heterogeneous data. Finally, we find that the entropy of the low dimensional clusters are directly representative of the entropy of the input data (Pearson Correlation = 0.99, R2 = 0.98) and therefore the reduced data from the deep autoencoder is reflective of the original CMR data variability.',\n",

The major concept was global public health is politics writ large, as determinants of health are rooted in economic and social power. Course objectives encouraged student agency in ameliorating population health status. Methods: We use three surveys, with qualitative and quantitative components, to assess interest and knowledge of public health issues, and determine whether student agency increased as the course progressed. Results: We confirmed that political science develops an excellent foundation for the analysis of issues related to global public health status. One course can stimulate curiosity in health issues. Unexpectedly, we discovered that students' greatest learning outcome integrated personal, interpersonal, and scholarly analyses of health issues. This provided an avenue for students outside of the health sciences to frame mental health, sexuality, and other stigmatized subjects within scholarly discourse. After the course, virtually all students had developed a sense of agency, hope, and tools to understand the roots of mental and physical health. Following case studies on various countries, students quickly grasped the significant impact of politics and economics on people's health. Discussion: We recommend that political science departments offer courses that focus on health for all alongside existing courses on healthcare systems' politics. Furthermore, departments of public health may benefit from including political science courses as core elements of their curriculum to assist graduates in navigating the highly politicized infrastructure of public health.

We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. Methods: Electronic databases were searched in November 2016. Fourteen studies totaling 911 BC patients on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or tamoxifen (TAM) and 911 controls (i.e., non-cancer controls and BC controls not using ET) were included. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into six domains. Effect sizes were computed to compare (1) ET patients versus controls and (2) TAM patients versus AI patients. Results: In cross-sectional comparisons, ET patients performed worse than control groups on verbal learning/memory, visual learning/memory, frontal executive function, and processing speed, but did not differ on psychomotor efficiency or visuospatial function. Subgroup analyses revealed that verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls. In other domains, ET patients and BC controls performed equivalently. Regarding change from pre-treatment performance, ET patients did not differ from controls on any domain. TAM and AI patients did not from one another differ overall; however, subgroup analyses indicated that TAM patients performed better than non-steroidal AI patients on several domains, but showed few performance differences relative to steroidal AI patients. Conclusions: Verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls, suggesting specific adverse effects on this domain. Additional studies assessing change from pre-treatment performance and differences between steroidal and non-steroidal AIs are warranted.',\n",

In interviews patients presented use of the internet as associated with appropriate self-management and help-seeking. In consultations patients skilfully translated what they had found on the internet in order to provide grounds for the actions they sought. We conclude that patients translate and utilise what they have found on the internet to assert the doctorability of their presenting problems. Furthermore, patients design their talk in both interviews and consultations to accord with their understanding of the epistemic rights of both doctors and patients. Patients search the internet so they are informed about their medical problem, however they carefully manage disclosure of information to avoid disrupting the smooth running of medical interactions.\",\n",
       "  '(0.355)  Background There is little data describing the differences in epinephrine (epi) administration and cardiac complications among older and younger patients with anaphylaxis. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two urban emergency departments (ED) over a 5 year-period, and included adults who met a pre-specified criteria for anaphylaxis. Patients =50\\xa0years of age were defined as \\x93older\\x94. Univariate logistic regression was performed to compare the difference in frequency of epi administration between the \\x93older\\x94 and \\x93younger\\x94 groups. Among those who received epi, the proportion of patients who received doses exceeding the recommended maximum and who had pre-specified cardiovascular complications were compared between the two groups, stratified further by route of administration. Results Of 2995 allergy-related visits, 492 met criteria for anaphylaxis, including 122 (24.8%) older patients. Older patients were less likely to receive epi injection (36.1% vs. 60.5%). Of those who received epi, older patients were more likely to receive excessive dose of epi (7/44, 15.9% vs 2/225, 0.9%, unadjusted OR 20.7, 95% CI 3.8\\x96211.7). Four (4/44, 9.1%) older patients experienced cardiovascular complications, compared to 1/225 (0.4%) in the younger group (unadjusted OR 22.4, 95% CI 2.1\\x961129.8). When examining only intra-muscular epinephrine, 1/31 older patients had cardiac complications, compared to 1/186 in the younger group. Conclusion Older patients with anaphylaxis were less likely to receive epi injection. Intramuscular epi appears safe in this population; however, the use of intravenous epi should be avoided in older patients due to the potential of developing serious cardiac complications.',\n",
       "  '(0.354)  Background: Sedative-hypnotic (SH) medications are often used to treat chronic insomnia, with potentially serious long-term side effects. The objective of this study is to evaluate an interprofessional SH deprescribing program within a community team-based, primary care practice, with or without cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Methods: Retrospective chart review for patients referred to the team pharmacist for SH deprescribing from February 2016 to June 2019. Results: A total of 121 patients were referred for SH deprescribing, with 111 (92%) patients who attempted deprescribing (average age 69, range 29-97 years) and 22 patients who also received CBT-I. Overall, 36 patients (32%) achieved complete abstinence, and another 36 patients (32%) reduced their dosage by =50%. For the 36 patients who achieved complete abstinence, 26 (72%) patients remained abstinent at 6 months (9 patients resumed using SH and 1 patient was lost to follow-up). The proportion of patients achieving complete abstinence or reduced dosage of =50% (successful tapering) was higher with CBT-I than without CBT-I but did not reach statistical significance (77% vs 62%, p = 0.22). There were also no statistically significant differences detected in the success between those who took a benzodiazepine and those who took a Z-drug (67% vs 61%, p = 0.55) or for those who took SH daily and those who took them intermittently (67% vs 44%, p = 0.09). Conclusion: Almost two-thirds of patients participating in our pharmacist-led program were able to stop or taper their SH medications by =50%. The role of CBT-I in SH deprescribing remains to be further elucidated. Can Pharm J (Ott) 2021;154:xx-xx.'],\n",

       "  '(0.718)  Literature reviews, and more particularly systematic reviews, are increasingly being produced and published. The past 40 years have been marked by considerable development of methodologies and methods in literature reviews. This paper aims to provide a brief historical overview of systematic reviews which will help to have a better understanding of what, why, when, and how they were developed. The paper is structured in three parts. The first part will provide a definition of systematic reviews and their main characteristics. The second part will present three main periods of the evolution of systematic reviews: foundation period (1970-1989), institutionalization period (1990-2000), and diversification period (2001-). These periods can be distinguished by the users of scientific evidence, the methodological influence, and the technological development. The last part will summarize the main elements in the history of the systematic reviews and present some direction for future research.',\n",
       "  \"(0.583)  Cochrane devolves most editorial governance of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), including title prioritization, protocol registration, peer-review, editorial oversight and subsequent review deposition, to specific Cochrane Review Group (CRG) editorial boards. Current Cochrane policy stipulates authors of reviews who are also members of the supporting CRG declare this non-financial conflict of interest and confirm no involvement in the review editorial process. The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to assess adherence to Cochrane's editorial conflict of interest policy. All 260 published Cochrane reviews (CR) in issues 1 to 6 from 2019 of the CDSR were reviewed. A total of 133 (51.2%, 133/260) of CRs had at least one author that was also listed as an editor in the CRG. Of these, only five (3.8%, 5/133) appropriately declared the conflict according to Cochrane policy. In 6.5% (17/133) CRs, the contact author had a leading editorial position within the CRG and in only four of 17 was this declared according to Cochrane policy. No CR with the contact author who also had a leading editorial position described methods to prevent any potential issues related to this scenario during the editorial process in accordance with Cochrane policy. We propose a specific form to improve the transparency and reliability of editorial conflict of interest reporting in CRs. The suggested form can be adapted to other contexts.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.578)  Background: In 2018, a so-called crisis developed in the international network of systematic reviewers known as Cochrane. It was widely depicted in terms of two competing narratives\\x97\\x93bad behaviour\\x94 by one member of Cochrane's Governing Board and scientific and moral decline within Cochrane. Objective: Our goal was to distil insights on the structural issues underpinning the crisis, without taking a definitive position on the accuracy of either narrative. Approach and dataset: In this paper, we draw on (among other theories) Becker's notion of moral entrepreneurship and Foucault's conceptualisation of power to analyse the claims and counterclaims made by different parties. Our dataset consisted of publicly available materials (blogs, journal articles, newspaper articles) to end 2018, notably those relating to the expulsion of one Governing Board member. Main findings: Both narratives include strong moral claims about the science of systematic review and the governance of scientific organizations. The expelled individual and his supporters defined good systematic reviews in terms of a particular kind of methodological rigour and elimination of bias, and good governance largely in terms of measures to achieve independence from industry influence. Most of Cochrane's Governing Board and their sympathizers evaluated systematic reviews according to a broader range of criteria, incorporating factors such as attention to relationships among reviewers and reflexivity and dialogue around scientific and other judgements. They viewed governance partly in terms of accountability to an external advisory group. Power-knowledge alignments in Cochrane have emerged from, and contributed to, a particular system of meaning which is now undergoing evolution and challenge. Conclusion: Polarizing Cochrane's \\x93crisis\\x94 into two narratives, only one of which is true, is less fruitful than viewing it in terms of a duality consisting of tensions between the two positions, each of which has some validity. Having framed the conflict as primarily philosophical and political rather than methodological and procedural, we suggest how Cochrane and its supporters and critics might harness their tensions productively.\",\n",
       "  '(0.572)  New approaches to evidence synthesis, which use human effort and machine automation in mutually reinforcing ways, can enhance the feasibility and sustainability of living systematic reviews. Human effort is a scarce and valuable resource, required when automation is impossible or undesirable, and includes contributions from online communities (\\x93crowds\\x94) as well as more conventional contributions from review authors and information specialists. Automation can assist with some systematic review tasks, including searching, eligibility assessment, identification and retrieval of full-text reports, extraction of data, and risk of bias assessment. Workflows can be developed in which human effort and machine automation can each enable the other to operate in more effective and efficient ways, offering substantial enhancement to the productivity of systematic reviews. This paper describes and discusses the potential\\x97and limitations\\x97of new ways of undertaking specific tasks in living systematic reviews, identifying areas where these human/machine \\x93technologies\\x94 are already in use, and where further research and development is needed. While the context is living systematic reviews, many of these enabling technologies apply equally to standard approaches to systematic reviewing.'],\n",
       " ['(0.552)  OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to describe the incidence of diabetes following pancreatic disease, assess how these patients are classified by clinicians, and compare clinical characteristics with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Primary care records in England (n = 2,360,631) were searched for incident cases of adult-onset diabetes between 1 January 2005 and 31 March 2016. We examined demographics, diabetes classification, glycemic control, and insulin use in those with and without pancreatic disease (subcategorized into acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatic disease) before diabetes diagnosis. Regression analysis was used to control for baseline potential risk factors for poor glycemic control (HbA1c =7% [53 mmol/mol]) and insulin requirement. RESULTS We identified 31,789 new diagnoses of adult-onset diabetes. Diabetes following pancreatic disease (2.59 [95%CI 2.38-2.81] per 100,000 person-years) wasmore common than type 1 diabetes (1.64 [1.47-1.82]; P < 0.001). The 559 cases of diabetes following pancreatic diseaseweremostly classified by clinicians as type 2 diabetes (87.8%) and uncommonly as diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (2.7%). Diabetes following pancreatic disease was diagnosed at a median age of 59 years and BMI of 29.2 kg/m2. Diabetes following pancreatic disease was associated with poor glycemic control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [1.3-2.2]; P < 0.001) compared with type 2 diabetes. Insulin use within 5 years was 4.1% (3.8-4.4) with type 2 diabetes, 20.9% (14.6-28.9) with diabetes following acute pancreatitis, and 45.8% (34.2-57.9) with diabetes following chronic pancreatic disease. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas is frequently labeled type 2 diabetes but hasworse glycemic control and a markedly greater requirement for insulin.',\n",
       "  '(0.548)  Aim: The purpose of the study was to analyse self-descriptions of diabetes burnout in individuals with Type 1 diabetes via YouTube videos. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study, a systematic approach was used to search YouTube videos with a title, description or content specifically about diabetes burnout dated between 2007 and 2017. Irrelevant or duplicated videos were excluded using eligibility criteria. All videos meeting inclusion criteria (n = 32) from individuals with Type 1 diabetes were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse video characteristics. Results: The four major themes associated with diabetes burnout were: (i) feeling mentally drained and physically tired of dealing with self-care; (ii) experiencing a detachment from self, diabetes care and support system; (iii) being powerless and paralysed to \\x91climb out\\x92 of diabetes burnout; and (iv) contributing potential factors to diabetes burnout. Conclusions: Self-descriptions of diabetes burnout suggest that it is a combination of emotions and behaviours on a spectrum from exhaustion to detachment accompanied by an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. More studies are needed to further clarify diabetes burnout and its distinction from, or overlap with, other related psychosocial concepts in diabetes care.',\n",
       "  '(0.522)  Aim To explore the influence of health beliefs and behaviours on diabetes management in British Indians, as successful management of diabetes is dependent on underlying cultural beliefs and behaviours. Background British South Asians are six times more likely to suffer from type II diabetes than those in the general population. Yet, little research has been carried out into beliefs about diabetes among the British Indian population. Method The study used semi-structured interviews, a structured vignette and a pile-sorting exercise. In all, 10 British Indians were interviewed at a General Practice in North West London. Findings Those interviewed were informed about their diabetes but had difficulties in adapting their diet. Themes identified included causal beliefs of diabetes, use of alternative therapies, moderation of food, adaption of exercise regimes and sources of information. All were aware of avoiding certain foods yet some still continued to consume these items. Participants expressed the need for culturally sensitive forums to help manage their diabetes.',\n",
       "  \"(0.503)  Addressing the emotional side of diabetes and its management has received considerable attention in recent years. At the centre of most of these efforts is the concept of \\x91diabetes distress', a generic term that captures the primary sources and intensity of emotional distress associated with diabetes and its management over time. As interest in diabetes distress has grown, however, it has been difficult to integrate and translate the various strands of clinical research in a manner that can guide diabetes distress intervention efforts in the real world of clinical care. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by outlining practical strategies for intervention in clinical settings and to assist diabetes healthcare professionals in thinking through how diabetes distress might be addressed practically in their clinics. To address these goals, this review is divided into five sections: a definition of diabetes distress, ways diabetes distress can be assessed and monitored, information about diabetes distress for use in intervention planning, topics to be considered for inclusion in diabetes distress interventions, and alternatives for where in the care process a diabetes distress intervention might be considered. We focus on diabetes distress experienced by adults with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\",\n",
       "  '(0.489)  Aims: Whether diabetes increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) is unclear. Any greater risk may relate to insulin resistance, but many studies did not differentiate between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes for VTE risk. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre, comprising over 530 primary care practices. We determined whether type 1 diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes are independent risk factors for VTE. The index date was 1 January 2009, individuals were followed to 31 December 2018, or censoring. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the risk of VTE in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes relative to no diabetes. The primary outcome was occurrence of VTE. The model was adjusted for potential confounders for VTE. Results: There were 7086 people with type 1 diabetes and 95,566 with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed before 1 January 2009. The non-diabetes group consisted of 1,407,699 people. In the unadjusted analysis, there was no increased risk of VTE with type 1 diabetes (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76\\x961.33) but there was for type 2 diabetes (HR 2.70, 95% CI 2.57\\x962.84). In the fully adjusted model, VTE risk was increased in type 1 diabetes (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11\\x961.92), but not with type 2 diabetes (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98\\x961.14). Conclusions: Type 1 diabetes was associated with a greater risk for VTE while type 2 diabetes was not. Further work is needed to determine the reason(s) for this.'],\n",
       " ['(0.497)  Objective: Treat-to-target (TTT) is an accepted paradigm for care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because TTT can be associated with more medication switches, concerns arise regarding whether implementing TTT may increase adverse events and/or resource use. The aim of this study was to examine adverse events and resource use during the preintervention and intervention periods of the TTT intervention trial. Methods: We used data from 6 practices enrolled in an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare adverse events and resource use before (months 1\\x969) and during (months 10\\x9618) a TTT intervention. The outcomes of interest, adverse events and resource use, were based on medical record review of all rheumatology visits for RA patients before and during the intervention. Results: We examined records for 321 patients before the intervention and 315 during the intervention. An adverse event was recorded in 10.2% of visits before the intervention and 8.8% of visits during the intervention (P = 0.41). Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were taken by 53.6% of patients before the intervention and 49.8% of patients during the intervention (P = 0.73). Rheumatology visits were more frequent before the intervention (mean ± SD 4.0 ± 1.4) than during the intervention (mean ± SD 3.6 ± 1.2; P = 0.02). More visits were accompanied by monitoring laboratory tests before the intervention (90.0%) compared with during the intervention (52.7%; P < 0.001). A greater percentage of visits before the intervention included diagnostic imaging (15.4%) versus during the intervention (8.9%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: We observed similar rates of adverse events before and during the implementation of TTT for RA. Rheumatology visits, use of laboratory monitoring, and diagnostic imaging did not increase during the TTT intervention.',\n",
       "  '(0.469)  Background: Reducing meat consumption could bring health and environmental benefits, but there is little research to date on effective interventions to achieve this. A non-randomised controlled intervention study was used to evaluate whether prominent positioning of meat-free products in the meat aisle was associated with a change in weekly mean sales of meat and meat-free products. Methods and findings Weekly sales data were obtained from 108 stores: 20 intervention stores that moved a selection of 26 meat-free products into a newly created meat-free bay within the meat aisle and 88 matched control stores. The primary outcome analysis used a hierarchical negative binomial model to compare changes in weekly sales (units) of meat products sold in intervention versus control stores during the main intervention period (Phase I: February 2019 to April 2019). Interrupted time series analysis was also used to evaluate the effects of the Phase I intervention. Moreover, 8 of the 20 stores enhanced the intervention from August 2019 onwards (Phase II intervention) by adding a second bay of meat-free products into the meat aisle, which was evaluated following the same analytical methods. During the Phase I intervention, sales of meat products (units/store/week) decreased in intervention (approximately -6%) and control stores (-5%) without significant differences (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.01 [95% CI 0.95-1.07]. Sales of meat-free products increased significantly more in the intervention (+31%) compared to the control stores (+6%; IRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.30-1.57]), mostly due to increased sales of meat-free burgers, mince, and sausages. Consistent results were observed in interrupted time series analyses where the effect of the Phase II intervention was significant in intervention versus control stores. Conclusions Prominent positioning of meat-free products into the meat aisle in a supermarket was not effective in reducing sales of meat products, but successfully increased sales of meat-free alternatives in the longer term.',\n",
       "  '(0.453)  Background: For working adults, about one-third of energy is consumed in the workplace making this an important context in which to reduce energy intake to tackle obesity. The aims of the current study were first, to identify barriers to the feasibility and acceptability of implementing calorie labelling in preparation for a larger trial, and second, to estimate the potential impact of calorie labelling on energy purchased in worksite cafeterias. Methods: Six worksite cafeterias were randomised to the intervention starting at one of six fortnightly periods, using a stepped wedge design. The trial was conducted between August and December 2016, across 17 study weeks. The intervention comprised labelling all cafeteria products for which such information was available with their calorie content (e.g. \"250 Calories\") displayed in the same font style and size as for price. A post-intervention survey with cafeteria patrons and interviews with managers and caterers were used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Intervention impact was assessed using generalised linear mixed modelling. The primary outcome was the total energy (kcal) purchased from intervention items in each cafeteria each day. Results: Recruitment and retention of worksite cafeterias proved feasible, with post-intervention feedback suggesting high levels of intervention acceptability. Several barriers to intervention implementation were identified, including chefs\\' discretion at implementing recipes and the manual recording of sales data. There was no overall effect of the intervention: -0.4% (95%CI -3.8 to 2.9, p = .803). One site showed a statistically significant effect of the intervention, with an estimated 6.6% reduction (95%CI -12.9 to - 0.3, p = .044) in energy purchased in the day following the introduction of calorie labelling, an effect that diminished over time. The remaining five sites did not show robust changes in energy purchased when calorie labelling was introduced. Conclusions: A calorie labelling intervention was acceptable to both cafeteria operators and customers. The predicted effect of labelling to reduce energy purchased was only evident at one out of six sites studied. Before progressing to a full trial, the calorie labelling intervention needs to be optimised, and a number of operational issues resolved.',\n",
       "  '(0.404)  Background: This paper describes the intervention planning process for the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP), a digital intervention to promote hypertension self-management. It illustrates how a Person-Based Approach can be integrated with theory- and evidence-based approaches. The Person-Based Approach to intervention development emphasises the use of qualitative research to ensure that the intervention is acceptable, persuasive, engaging and easy to implement. Methods: Our intervention planning process comprised two parallel, integrated work streams, which combined theory-, evidence- and person-based elements. The first work stream involved collating evidence from a mixed methods feasibility study, a systematic review and a synthesis of qualitative research. This evidence was analysed to identify likely barriers and facilitators to uptake and implementation as well as design features that should be incorporated in the HOME BP intervention. The second work stream used three complementary approaches to theoretical modelling: developing brief guiding principles for intervention design, causal modelling to map behaviour change techniques in the intervention onto the Behaviour Change Wheel and Normalisation Process Theory frameworks, and developing a logic model. Results: The different elements of our integrated approach to intervention planning yielded important, complementary insights into how to design the intervention to maximise acceptability and ease of implementation by both patients and health professionals. From the primary and secondary evidence, we identified key barriers to overcome (such as patient and health professional concerns about side effects of escalating medication) and effective intervention ingredients (such as providing in-person support for making healthy behaviour changes). Our guiding principles highlighted unique design features that could address these issues (such as online reassurance and procedures for managing concerns). Causal modelling ensured that all relevant behavioural determinants had been addressed, and provided a complete description of the intervention. Our logic model linked the hypothesised mechanisms of action of our intervention to existing psychological theory. Conclusion: Our integrated approach to intervention development, combining theory-, evidence- and person-based approaches, increased the clarity, comprehensiveness and confidence of our theoretical modelling and enabled us to ground our intervention in an in-depth understanding of the barriers and facilitators most relevant to this specific intervention and user population.',\n",
       "  \"(0.402)  Background: A modified theory of planned behaviour (acronym CASCADA) proposes that Conscious knowledge precedes a change in Attitude, which in turn precedes positive deviations from negative Subjective norms, intention to Change, perception of Agency to change, Discussion of possible action, and Action itself. We used this as a results chain to investigate gender-specific behaviour dynamics in chemical-free dengue prevention. Methods: Secondary analysis of the Mexican arm of a cluster randomised controlled trial used household survey data on intermediate outcomes of dengue prevention behaviour. We used a matrix of odds ratios between outcomes, transformed to a symmetrical range (-1, 1), to compute fuzzy transitive closure of the results chain for control and intervention clusters, then for male and female respondents separately in each group. Transitive closure of a map computes the influence of each factor on each other factor, taking account of all influences in the system. Cumulative net influence was the sum of influences across the results chain. Results: Responses of 5042 women and 1143 men in 45 intervention clusters contrasted with those of 5025 women and 1179 men in 45 control clusters. Control clusters showed a distal block (negative influence) in the results chain with a cumulative net influence of 0.88; intervention clusters showed no such block and a cumulative net influence of 1.92. Female control respondents, like the overall control picture, showed a distal block, whereas female intervention responses showed no such blocks (cumulative net influence 0.78 and 1.73 respectively). Male control respondents showed weak distal blocks. Male intervention responses showed several new negative influences and a reduction of cumulative net influence (1.38 in control and 1.11 in intervention clusters). Conclusions: The overall influence of the intervention across the results chain fits with the trial findings, but is different for women and men. Among women, the intervention overcame blocks and increased the cumulative net influence of knowledge on action. Among men, the intervention did not reinforce prevention behaviour. This might be related to emphasis, during the intervention, on women's participation and empowerment. The fuzzy transitive closure of the CASCADA map usefully highlights the differences between gender-specific results chains. Trial registration: ISRCTN27581154.\"],\n",
       " ['(0.739)  Objective: Clinicians spend significant time working in the electronic health record (EHR). The US is an outlier in EHR time, suggesting that EHR-related work may be driven in part by the legal environment and threat of malpractice. To assess this, we evaluate the association between state-level malpractice climate and clinician time spent in the EHR. Materials and Methods: We use EHR metadata from 351 ambulatory care health systems in the United States using Epic from January-August 2019 combined with state-level data on malpractice incidence and payouts. We used descriptive statistics to measure variation in clinician EHR time, including total EHR time, documentation time per day, and after-hours EHR time per day. Multi-variable regression evaluated the association between clinicians in high malpractice states and EHR use. Results: We found no association between location in a state in the top-quartile of malpractice payouts and time spent in the EHR per day, time spent in the EHR outside of scheduled hours, or time spent documenting per day, except for a subgroup of the clinicians in the highest malpractice specialties, where there was a small increase in EHR time per day (B = 6.08 min, P < 0.001) and time spent documenting notes (B = 2.77 min, P < 0.001). Discussion: State-level differences in malpractice incidence are unlikely to be a significant driver of EHR work for most clinicians. Conclusion: Policymakers seeking to address EHR documentation burden should examine burden driven by other socio-technical demands on clinician time, such as billing or quality measurement.',\n",
       "  '(0.717)  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union provides for an extension of Canadian patents for prescription drugs by up to 2 years. One of the arguments advanced for longer patent time is to compensate companies for the length of the overall drug development time (the time between patent application and market approval). This study investigates overall development time in Canada for different groups of drugs approved between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018 and how many of these drugs are eligible for up to 2 years of patent term extension. Based on a list of patents and dates of market approval, the change in overall development time for all drugs was calculated along with whether there were differences in development time between different groups of drugs. Using Canadian patent filing dates, overall development time for all drugs went from a mean of 2240 days (95% CI: 1832, 2648) in 2009 to 4197 days (95% CI: 3728, 4665) in 2018 (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < .0001). Using first global patent filing dates, overall development time went from a mean of 4481 days (95% CI: 3053, 5908) in 2009 to 6298 days (95% CI: 4839, 7756) in 2018 (ANOVA, P = .0118). There was a statistically significant difference in the overall development mean time between small molecule drugs (3553, 95% CI: 3361, 3746) and biologics (3903, 95% CI: 3595, 4212), (t test, P = .0487) when using Canadian patent filing dates but not when first global patent filing dates were used. There was no statistically significant change in overall development time among drugs that were substantial, moderate or little to none additional therapeutic value compared to existing drugs. Out of 238 drugs, 218 (91.6%) would have been eligible for patent term extension with 195 (80.7%) eligible for the full 2 years. Patent term extension does not appear to be justified based on changes in overall development time, except possibly in the case of biologics. There are also trade offs in terms of increased expenditures that need to be considered if patent terms are lengthened.',\n",
       "  '(0.573)  Canada has strengthened intellectual property (IP) protections for pharmaceutical drugs several times over the last 3 decades. This study investigates whether the IP changes had an effect on the market exclusivity time of brand products on the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) formulary. We constructed a database that included the first brand approval date for drugs launched between 1974 and 2012, the first ODB listing date of the brand drug, and the first ODB listing date of the generic form of the drug. We then calculated the time of formulary exclusivity to detect any changes in market exclusivity times associated with changes to Canada\\x92s IP regimen. There were 595 drugs launched between 1974 and 2012 that were available for analysis. Exclusivity gradually declined from the late 1970s to 1990. Drugs approved in 2004 received 7.6 years of exclusivity, and drugs approved in 2005 received 5 years of exclusivity.

       "  '(0.565)  Objectives This study examines the length of time between when a patent application is filed in Canada for a new drug and when it is available for patients (time to market) and various components of that time. It also looks at whether various factors explain the time between patent application to New Drug Submission (NDS) and compares Canadian and American times. Drugs approved between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 are examined. Design Descriptive study. Data sources Websites from Health Canada, Food and Drug Administration, Merck Index, United States Patent and Trademark Office, WHO and previously published articles. Interventions None. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes are time to market, time from patent application to NDS (pre-NDS time), review time, time from approval to availability (postapproval time) and factors that may influence the pre-NDS time. The secondary outcome is a comparison of Canadian and American review times and times between patent application and approval. Results There were 113 drugs available for analysis. The median time to market was 11.80 years (IQR 9.40-14.05). The component median times were pre-NDS 10 years (IQR 8.05-12.80), review time 0.96 years (IQR 0.75-1.15) and postapproval time 0.15 years (IQR 0.08-0.28). Less than 8% of the pre-NDS time was explained by the factors that were analysed in a multiple linear regression equation. There was no statistically significant difference between Canadian and American pre-NDS times. Conclusion Once a drug reaches the market, companies have a median of 8.2 years before the patent expires and generics can reach the market. Most of the time between the filing of a patent application and when a drug is marketed is determined by decisions that are largely under the control of the company.',\n",
       "  '(0.558)  Background: Drone-delivered defibrillators have the potential to significantly reduce response time for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, optimal policies for the dispatch of such drones are not yet known. We sought to develop dispatch rules for a network of defibrillator-carrying drones. Methods: We identified all suspected OHCAs in Peel Region, Ontario, Canada from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2019. We developed drone dispatch rules based on the difference between a predicted ambulance response time to a calculated drone response time for each OHCA. Ambulance response times were predicted using linear regression and neural network models, while drone response times were calculated using drone specifications from recent pilot studies and the literature. We evaluated the dispatch rules based on response time performance and dispatch decisions, comparing them to two baseline policies of never dispatching and always dispatching drones. Results: A total of 3573 suspected OHCAs were included in the study with median and mean historical ambulance response times of 5.8 and 6.2 min. All machine learning-based dispatch rules significantly reduced the median response time to 3.9 min and mean response time to 4.1\\x964.2 min (all P < 0.001) and were non-inferior to universally dispatching drones (all P < 0.001) while reducing the number of drone flights by up to 30%. Dispatch rules with more drone flights achieved higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy. Conclusion: Machine learning-based dispatch rules for drone-delivered defibrillators can achieve similar response time reductions as universal drone dispatch while substantially reducing the number of trips.'],\n",

Design Population-based retrospective observational study using linked health administrative databases. Records of hospitalisations and emergency department visits were searched to identify cases using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada diagnostic codes. Participants All Ontario residents. Primary outcome measures Incidence rates of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous thrombosis during five prepandemic years (2015-2019) and 2020. Results The average annual population was 14 million with 51% female. The mean annual rates per 100 000 population during 2015-2019 were 127.1 (95% CI 126.2 to 127.9) for ischaemic stroke, 22.0 (95% CI 21.6 to 22.3) for intracerebral haemorrhage, 9.4 (95% CI 9.2 to 9.7) for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 86.8 (95% CI 86.1 to 87.5) for deep vein thrombosis, 63.7 (95% CI 63.1 to 64.3) for pulmonary embolism, 6.1 (95% CI 5.9 to 6.3) for idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, 1.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.7) for disseminated intravascular coagulation, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.6) for cerebral venous thrombosis. Rates were lower in 2020 than during the prepandemic years for ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and idiopathic thrombocytopaenia. Rates were generally consistent over time, except for pulmonary embolism, which increased from 57.1 to 68.5 per 100 000 between 2015 and 2019. Rates were higher for females than males for subarachnoid haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and cerebral venous thrombosis, and vice versa for ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage. Rates increased with age for most of these conditions, but idiopathic thrombocytopaenia demonstrated a bimodal distribution with incidence peaks at 0-19 years and =60 years. Conclusions Our estimated background rates help contextualise observed events of these potential adverse events of special interest and to detect potential safety signals related to COVID-19 vaccines.',\n",
       "  '(0.459)  Objectives An evidence-based emergency department (ED) atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) pathway was developed to improve care. The primary objective was to measure rates of new anticoagulation (AC) on ED discharge for AFF patients who were not AC correctly upon presentation.Methods This is a pre-post evaluation from April to December 2013 measuring the impact of our pathway on rates of new AC and other performance measures in patients with uncomplicated AFF solely managed by emergency physicians. A standardized chart review identified demographics, comorbidities, and ED treatments. The primary outcome was the rate of new AC. Secondary outcomes were ED length of stay (LOS), referrals to AFF clinic, ED revisit rates, and 30-day rates of return visits for congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, major bleeding, and death.Results ED AFF patients totalling 301 (129 pre-pathway [PRE]; 172 post-pathway [POST]) were included; baseline demographics were similar between groups. The rates of AC at ED presentation were 18.6% (PRE) and 19.7% (POST). The rates of new AC on ED discharge were 48.6 % PRE (95% confidence interval [CI] 42.1%-55.1%) and 70.2% POST (62.1%-78.3%) (20.6% [p<0.01; 15.1-26.3]). Median ED LOS decreased from 262 to 218 minutes (44 minutes [p<0.03; 36.2-51.8]). Thirty-day rates of ED revisits for CHF decreased from 13.2% to 2.3% (10.9%; p<0.01; 8.1%-13.7%), and rates of other measures were similar.Conclusions The evidence-based pathway led to an improvement in the rate of patients with new AC upon discharge, a reduction in ED LOS, and decreased revisit rates for CHF.',\n",
       "  '(0.439)  Background: Given concerns about risks associated with the growing use of mobile phones over recent decades, the authors analyzed temporal trends in incidence rates of nonmalignant meningioma and vestibular schwannoma in the United States. Methods: The incidence of nonmalignant meningioma and vestibular schwannoma among adults in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries during 2004 through 2017 was evaluated according to the method of diagnosis: microscopically (MC) or radiographically confirmed (RGC). Annual percent changes (APCs) and 95% CIs were estimated using log-linear models. Results: Overall meningioma rates (n = 108,043) increased significantly from 2004 to 2009 (APC, 5.4%; 95% CI, 4.4%-6.4%) but subsequently rose at a slower pace through 2017 (APC, 1.0%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.5%). Rates for MC meningiomas changed little from 2004 to 2017 (APC, -0.3%; 95% CI, -0.7%, 0.1%) but rose rapidly for RGC meningiomas until 2009 (APC, 9.5%; 95% CI, 7.8%-11.1%) and rose more modestly thereafter (APC, 2.3%; 95% CI, 1.5%-3.0%). Overall vestibular schwannoma rates (n = 17,475) were stable (APC, 0.4%; 95% CI, -0.2%, 1.0%), but MC vestibular schwannoma rates decreased (APC, -1.9%; 95% CI, -2.7%, -1.1%), whereas RGC vestibular schwannoma rates rose (2006-2017: APC, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.0%). For each tumor, the trends by diagnostic method were similar for each sex and each racial/ethnic group, but RGC diagnosis was more likely in older patients and for smaller tumors. Meningioma trends and the proportion of RGC diagnoses varied notably by registry. Conclusions: Overall trends obscured differences by diagnostic method in this first large, detailed assessment, but the recent stable rates argue against an association with mobile phone use. Variation among registries requires evaluation to improve the registration of these nonmalignant tumors. Lay Summary: The etiology of most benign meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas is poorly understood, but concerns have been raised about whether mobile phone use contributes to risk of developing these tumors. Descriptive studies examining temporal trends could provide insight; however, globally, few registries collect these nonmalignant cases. In the United States, reporting benign meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas became required by law in 2004. This was the first large, systematic study to quantify and characterize incidence trends for meningioma and vestibular schwannoma according to whether the tumors were diagnosed microscopically or only radiographically. Differential trends across registries and by diagnostic method suggest that caution should be used when interpreting the patterns.',\n",
       "  '(0.435)  Introduction Suicide rates and the proportion of alcohol-involved suicides rose during the 2008\\x962009 recession. Associations between county-level poverty, foreclosures, and unemployment and suicide rates and proportion of alcohol-involved suicides were investigated. Methods In 2015, National Violent Death Reporting System data from 16 states in 2005\\x962011 were utilized to calculate suicide rates and a measure of alcohol involvement in suicides at the county level. Panel models with year and state fixed effects included county-level measures of unemployment, foreclosure, and poverty rates. Results Poverty rates were strongly associated with suicide rates for both genders and all age groups, were positively associated with alcohol involvement in suicides for men aged 45\\x9664 years, and negatively associated for men aged 20\\x9644 years. Foreclosure rates were negatively associated with suicide rates for women and those aged =65 years but positively related for those aged 45\\x9664 years. Unemployment rate effects on suicide rates were mediated by poverty rates in all groups. Conclusions Population risk of suicide was most clearly associated with county-level poverty rates, indicating that programs addressing area poverty should be targeted for reducing suicide risk. Poverty rates were also associated with increased alcohol involvement for men aged 45\\x9664 years, indicating a role for alcohol in suicide for this working-aged group. However, negative associations between economic indicators and alcohol involvement were found for four groups, suggesting that non-economic factors or more general economic effects not captured by these indicators may have played a larger role in alcohol-related suicide increases.',\n",
       "  '(0.435)  Background: Shopping for health insurance is encouraged as a way to find the most affordable coverage that best meets an enrollee\\x92s needs. However, the extent to which individuals switch insurance and subsequent changes in health care utilization that might arise, particularly new physician visits, are not well understood. Objective: To examine the relationship between insurance switching and new physician and emergency department visits around the time of a switch. Design: Observational study using a difference-in-differences design to compare those switching insurance carriers with propensity score-matched controls who did not switch, stratified based on whether individuals initially had private or Medicaid insurance coverage. All analyses adjusted for individual and insurance characteristics. Participants: Continuously insured, non-elderly individuals with private or Medicaid insurance coverage in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013. Main Measures: Rates of new primary care and specialist physician visits, as well as rates of emergency department visits. Key Results: Before matching, among 1,628,057 continuously insured individuals, 418,231 (26%) switched insurance carriers during a 2-year period. Characteristics of switchers and non-switchers were similar after matching (n\\xa0=\\xa0316,343 in each group). After matching, switching plans was associated with a 203% and 47.5% increase in the rate of new primary care physician visits following switching for those initially with Medicaid or private coverage, respectively (both p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), with a large short-term increase, diminishing over time. Among those with Medicaid coverage, switching was associated with a 14.9% higher rate of ED visits during the month of switching (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), but otherwise decreased modestly after switching. Conclusions: Insurance switching is common, and is associated with increased new physician visits and temporarily increased ED use among the publicly insured. As insurance markets become more volatile in the current policy environment, understanding changes in utilization after insurance switching may become increasingly important.'],\n",
       " [\"(0.388)  Background Cam morphology, a distinct bony morphology of the hip, is prevalent in many athletes, and a risk factor for hip-related pain and osteoarthritis. Secondary cam morphology, due to existing or previous hip disease (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease), is well-described. Cam morphology not clearly associated with a disease is a challenging concept for clinicians, scientists and patients. We propose this morphology, which likely develops during skeletal maturation as a physiological response to load, should be referred to as primary cam morphology. The aim of this study was to introduce and clarify the concept of primary cam morphology. Design We conducted a concept analysis of primary cam morphology using articles that reported risk factors associated with primary cam morphology; we excluded articles on secondary cam morphology. The concept analysis method is a rigorous eight-step process designed to clarify complex ' concepts'; the end product is a precise definition that supports the theoretical basis of the chosen concept. Results We propose five defining attributes of primary cam morphology-tissue type, size, site, shape and ownership-in a new conceptual and operational definition. Primary cam morphology is a cartilage or bony prominence (bump) of varying size at the femoral head-neck junction, which changes the shape of the femoral head from spherical to aspherical. It often occurs in asymptomatic male athletes in both hips. The cartilage or bone alpha angle (calculated from radiographs, CT or MRI) is the most common method to measure cam morphology. We found inconsistent reporting of primary cam morphology taxonomy, terminology, and how the morphology is operationalised. Conclusion We introduce and clarify primary cam morphology, and propose a new conceptual and operational definition. Several elements of the concept of primary cam morphology remain unclear and contested. Experts need to agree on the new taxonomy, terminology and definition that better reflect the primary cam morphology landscape- A bog-standard bump in most athletic hips, and a possible hip disease burden in a selected few.\",\n",
       "  '(0.381)  Background: Physician assistants (PAs) are often suggested as a partial solution to predicted primary care workforce shortages, but a declining proportion of PAs are entering primary care practice. Policy efforts have focused on increasing primary care PA supply, but low labor market demand might be constricting the primary care PA pipeline. Method: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we compare primary care and specialty job postings to each other and to occupied PA positions. Job posting data for 2014 are from a leading labor analytics firm. Results: Only 18% of job postings were in primary care, compared with 27% of occupied PA positions. The proportion of postings that were for primary care varied widely by state (9% to 40%) and were highest in the West. Discussion: Job availability is a potential barrier to PAs practicing in primary care, especially in some locations. Other job factors are examined and policy solutions are suggested.',\n",
       "  '(0.361)  Part 1 of this essay argued that the root causes of primary care\\x92s problems lie in (1) the low percent of national health expenditures dedicated to primary care and (2) overly large patient panels that clinicians without a team are unable to manage, leading to widespread burnout and poor patient access. Part 2 explores policies and practice changes that could solve or mitigate these primary care problems. Initiatives attempting to improve primary care are discussed. Diffuse multi-component ini-tiatives\\x97patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), accountable care organizations (ACOs), and Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+)\\x97have had limited success in addressing primary care\\x92s core problems.

       "  \"(0.328)  Introduction: Primary cam morphology is a mostly benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip, but it is highly prevalent in many athlete populations. In the small proportion of athletes for whom it is not benign, the resulting hip osteoarthritis can be debilitating. Clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers do not yet agree on important primary cam morphology elements. We aimed to ascertain and improve the level of agreement on primary cam morphology definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures. Methods: To collect and aggregate informed opinions, an expert panel - the Young Athlete's Hip Research Collaborative - rated primary cam morphology definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome statements through an online Delphi exercise followed by an online meeting to explore areas of tension and dissent. Reporting followed Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies. Results: A diverse and inclusive Delphi panel (n=65 for rounds 1 and 2, representing 18 countries; 6 stakeholder groups; 40% women) agreed on 35 of 47 statements in 4 domains, while surfacing areas of tension and dissent. This Delphi panel agreed on four key issues essential to moving research and clinical care forward around primary cam morphology. They agreed on: (1) definition, confirming its conceptual attributes (tissue type, size, location, shape and ownership); (2) terminology - use 'morphology' and not terms with a negative connotation like 'lesion', 'abnormality' or 'deformity'; (3) taxonomy, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology, and (4) imaging outcomes, a continuous bone/cartilage alpha angle on radial femoral head-neck MRI for primary cam morphology aetiology research. Conclusion: This consensus provides athletes, patients, clinicians and researchers with a strong foundation to guide more precise communication, better clinical decision-making and higher value research about primary cam morphology and its natural history.\",\n",
       "  '(0.303)  Objective To develop a composite measure of primary care quality and apply it to Haiti\\x92s primary care system. Methods Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative\\x92s framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.00\\x960.49, 0.50\\x960.74 and 0.75\\x961.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively. Findings Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4%), management and organization (91; 12%) and primary care functions (43; 5%). Although about 91% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23% of the entire population \\x96 including just 5% of the rural population \\x96 had access to primary care of good quality. Conclusion Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas. Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems.'],\n",

This study examines whether anxiety increases the gender gap in risk-seeking, whereas sadness closes the gender gap in risk-seeking, a pattern we call the Emotional Fluctuation Effect. In two studies, one with an adolescent sample and the other employing an adult sample, we find similar levels of risk-seeking when males are in anxious or sad states. By contrast, anxious females are less riskseeking than anxious males (study 1 and study 2), and anxious adolescent girls are less risk-seeking than sad adolescent girls (study 1). Together our findings indicate that gender differences in risk-seeking can be explained in part by anxious girls and women avoiding risky behaviors.',\n",
       "  '(0.402)  Objective: Wine glass size may influence perceived volume and subsequently purchasing and consumption. Using a larger glass to serve the same portions of wine was found to increase wine sales by 9.4% (95% CI 1.9, 17.5) in a recent study conducted in one bar. The current study aimed to replicate this previous work in two other bars using a wider range of glass sizes. To match the previous study, a repeated multiple treatment reversal design, during which wine was served in glasses of the same design but different sizes, was used. The study was conducted in two bars in Cambridge, England, using glass sizes of 300, 370, 510 ml (Bar 1) and 300 and 510 ml (Bar 2). Customers purchased their choice of a 750 ml bottle, or standard UK measures of 125, 175 or 250 ml of wine, each of which was served with the same glass. Results: Bar 1 Daily wine volume (ml) purchased was 10.5% (95% CI 1.0, 20.9) higher when sold in 510 ml compared to 370 ml glasses; but sales were not significantly higher with 370 ml versus 300 ml glasses (6.5%, 95% CI -5.2, 19.6). Bar 2 Findings were inconclusive as to whether daily wine purchased differed when using 510 ml versus 300 ml glasses (-1.1%, 95% CI -12.6, 11.9). These results provide a partial replication of previous work showing that introducing larger glasses (without manipulating portion size) increases purchasing. Understanding the mechanisms by which wine glass size influences consumption may elucidate when the effect can be expected and when not.

This study develops an understanding of student experience of the campus as a learning landscape. It is based on 28 participatory walking interviews with students, including the hand drawing of a campus map. Participants tended to see learning as about individual study or working alongside others, and rarely mentioned lectures. The choice of space to study was often shaped by convenience, and appeared to be somewhat static and habitual. There was a lack of exploration and only a limited sense of the benefit of fitting the learning task to the space. Yet students felt a sense of ownership and safety on campus.

       "  '(0.385)  Background: Reducing alcohol consumption across populations would prevent many non-communicable diseases. Large packages increase food and non-alcoholic drink consumption and large glasses increase wine consumption. Smaller bottles may reduce alcohol consumption but their impact is uncertain. This study aims to (i) explore the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption and (ii) estimate the effect size and variance of the intervention on consumption to inform the design of future studies. Methods: Cross-over randomised study in which 16 households in Cambridge, England, consuming at least two 750-ml bottles of wine each week, received a pre-set volume of wine biweekly for 4 weeks, in 750-ml and 375-ml bottles, in random order. Consumption was assessed by recording the number of empty and partially full bottles at the end of each biweekly period. At the end of the study, household representatives were interviewed about their experiences of participating in the study. Results: The study procedures proved feasible. Comparable to similar trials, 14% of identified eligible households (18/125) consented to participate in the study. Attrition between consent and study completion was 11% (2/18) and 0% between study periods and 13% of households (2/16) correctly identified the study aim. The study procedures were considered acceptable. After adjusting for guest and out-of-home consumption, the difference in consumption between the 750-ml (3385.2 ml; SD = 1698.5) and 375-ml bottles (3376.7 ml; SD = 1719.0) was 8.4 ml (SD = 1235.4; 95%CI - 596.9, 613.8). Results suggest a possible order effect, with households receiving the 375-ml bottles first consuming more wine out of the 750-ml bottles and vice versa. This might also reflect an increase in consumption with study duration. Households receiving the 375-ml bottles first (6315.9 ml; SD = 3293.5) also drank less wine overall than those receiving the 750-ml bottles first (7335.4 ml; SD = 3735.4). Discussion: The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of running a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption. Due to the heterogeneous patterning of results, a future study will be powered using the variance observed in the current study to detect a meaningful reduction of 250 ml of wine when consumed from smaller compared with larger bottles.

One year later, each child completed both a developmental assessment and an observational assessment of empathic responding. Behaviors typical for children with autism were distinguished from behaviors suggestive of relationally based attachment disorganization. Forty-five percent of the children were classified as securely attached. The secure group demonstrated language skills superior to those of the insecurely attached group, concurrently and during the follow-up. Compared to parents of children who were insecurely attached, parents of securely attached children were rated as more sensitive. Compared to both organized insecure and disorganized children, secure children were rated as more responsive to an examiner\\x92s apparent distress during the follow-up relative to their ratings at intake, whereas empathy ratings of children with insecure classifications did not increase. Importantly, attachment security was associated with empathy above and beyond the contribution of children\\x92s language level.

Methods: In 2017, 100 population clusters within the Narayani Zone of Nepal were selected using RAAB software. Children (aged 0\\x9615 years) suspected of having visual problems were identified using Key Informants (KIs) and school teachers and were referred for ophthalmologic examination. Eye care staff actively sought children who failed to present for examination. Causes of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI were categorized using standard World Health Organization definitions. Results: Of 76,588 children selected, 72,900 (95%) were screened. Of 2,158 children referred for examination, 1,322 were referred by teachers and 836 by KIs. A total of 1,617 (75%) children received a detailed examination, of whom 128 children [65 girls (51%)] mean age of 9.4 (± 4.1 years) were confirmed to have BL 7 (5.5%), SVI 16 (12.5%), ModVI 19 (15%) or MildVI 86 (67%).

The leading causes of BL/SVI/MVI were refractive error 23 (55%) and whole globe disorders 5 (12%). Total avoidable causes were 31 (74%). Conclusion: The prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI among children in Narayani Zone was moderate and included a high proportion of avoidable and treatable cases. Pediatric ophthalmic services need improvement, mainly refractive error correction in rural areas of Nepal.',\n",
       "  \"(0.591)  Background: The ecosystemic approach to children's needs demands a cohesive response from societies, communities, and families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the choices societies made to protect their community members from the virus could have created contexts of child neglect. With the closure of services and institutions, societies were no longer available to help meet the needs of children. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine parents\\x92 reports on the response their children received to their needs during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: During the period of the spring 2020 lockdown, 414 parents in the province of Quebec, Canada, completed an online questionnaire about the impact of the crisis on the response their children received to their needs. Results: Compared to parents of younger children, parents of older children reported less fulfillment of their child's needs in three measured domains, namely cognitive and affective, security, and basic care needs. Conclusion: These results are discussed in light of the policies and the resources societies have put in place during the crisis to help families meet the needs of their children. Societies must learn from this crisis to put children at the top of their priorities in the face of a societal crisis. Thoughtful discussions and energy must be given to ensure that, while facing a crisis, the developmental trajectories of children are not sacrificed.\",\n",

       " ['(0.46)  Purpose: To examine the association between contextual factors, represented by geographic and community health variables, and suicide among rural and urban Department of Veterans Affairs health care users (VA users). Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 12,700,847 VA users between 2003 and 2017. We assigned contextual factors based on individuals\\x92 home address at the ZIP Code (area deprivation), county (sunlight exposure, altitude, and community health), and state level (firearm ownership), using publicly available data sources. We grouped contextual factors by quintiles or prespecified thresholds, depending on the nature of each variable. We obtained mortality data from the National Death Index. We measured the effect of living in a place with the highest versus lowest level of each contextual factor on odds of suicide using logistic regression, adjusting for individual compositional factors abstracted from VA electronic medical records data. We used random forest modeling to build prediction models for suicide based on contextual factors among rural and urban veterans. Findings: Almost all contextual factors we examined were significantly associated with suicide among rural and urban VA users, even after adjusting for individual compositional factors. However, no contextual variables were strong protective or risk factors (0.5<OR>2.0), and prediction models leveraging these contextual factors had poor accuracy among both rural (0.51, 95% CI: 0.48-0.54) and urban (0.53, 95% CI: 0.51-0.55) VA users. Conclusions: A wide variety of contextual factors is significantly associated with suicide among rural and urban VA users. However, the factors we measured contributed very little to individual-level suicide risk.',\n",
       "  '(0.375)  The objectives of this paper are to: (1) identify contextual factors such as policy that impacted the implementation of community-based primary health care (CBPHC) innovations among 12 Canadian research teams and (2) describe strategies used by the teams to address contextual factors influencing implementation of CBPHC innovations. In primary care settings, consideration of contextual factors when implementing change has been recognized as critically important to success. However, contextual factors are rarely recorded, analyzed or considered when implementing change. The lack of consideration of contextual factors has negative implications not only for successfully implementing primary health care (PHC) innovations, but also for their sustainability and scalability. For this evaluation, data collection was conducted using self-administered questionnaires and follow-up telephone interviews with team representatives. We used a combination of directed and conventional content analysis approaches to analyze the questionnaire and interview data. Representatives from all 12 teams completed the questionnaire and 11 teams participated in the interviews; 40 individuals participated in this evaluation. Four themes representing contextual factors that impacted the implementation of CBPHC innovations were identified: (I) diversity of jurisdictions (II) complexity of interactions and collaborations (III) policy, and (IV) the multifaceted nature of PHC. The teams used six strategies to address these contextual factors including: (1) conduct an environmental scan at the beginning (2) maintaining engagement among partners and stakeholders by encouraging open and inclusive communication; (3) contextualizing the innovation for different settings; (4) anticipating and addressing changes, delays, and the need for additional resources; (5) fostering a culture of research and innovation among partners and stakeholders; and (6) ensuring information about the innovation is widely available. Implementing CBPHC innovations across jurisdictions is complex and involves navigating through multiple contextual factors. Awareness of the dynamic nature of context should be considered when implementing innovations.',\n",

Inspired by the concept of SE, we conducted a mixed methods study of a smartphone application (app) as a platform of SE. Objectives were to: (phase 1 quantitative) estimate the extent to which weekly alerts on the app can stimulate medical residents to visit the app, (connection of phases) identify participants for a second qualitative phase, and (phase 2 qualitative) describe factors, from the resident perspective, which influence sustainable participation in SE, and describe strategies for improvement of the app. Methodology and methods: phase-1 design was pre-experimental, phase-2 design was qualitative descriptive (deductive-inductive thematic analysis). Results: We observed a stimulating effect of weekly alerts for the first two months of the one-year study. Per participant, alert visits varied from 0 to 34 (mean = 1.7, SD = 4.5) and total page visits varied from 1 to 442 (mean = 28.3, SD = 61.4). Barriers and facilitators to sustainable participation in SE fell into five dimensions: user-related factors, information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors. Four strategies for app improvement were described. In conclusion, we propose five dimensions pertaining to potential predictors of sustainable participation in SE to deliver clinical information.',\n",

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study in December 2015 included 1305 homes in eight urban clusters considered representative of Acapulco in southern Mexico. Administered questionnaires collated information on 5870 individuals, including sociodemographic variables, a history of chronic conditions, and the self-reporting of chikungunya. Bivariate and multivariate analyses relied on a cluster-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel procedure to identify the factors associated with chikungunya and its relapse. Results: Some 66% (3531/5870) of the population reported suffering chikungunya and 31.1% (1098/3531) reported a relapse. Factors associated with relapse included the severity of the chikungunya case (odds ratio [OR]: 3.35; clusters adjusted 95% confidence interval [95% CIca]: 3.16-3.55); history of arthralgia (OR: 2.96; 95% CIca: 2.27-3.86); age 30 years or older (OR: 1.85; 95% CIca: 1.72-1.98); female (OR: 1.64; 95% CIca: 1.42-1.90); and higher education households (OR: 1.18; 95% CIca: 1.11-1.27). Conclusions: The high occurrence of chikungunya and its relapse are a public health problem. The factors associated with relapse do not immediately suggest specific prevention strategies but emphasize the dire need for effective approaches to vector control.'],\n",
       " ['(0.529)  Twin studies suggest a familial aggregation of bladder cancer, but elements of this increased familial risk of bladder cancer are not well understood. To characterize familial risk of bladder cancer, we examined the relationship between family history of bladder and other types of cancer among first-degree relatives and risk of bladder cancer in 1193 bladder cancer cases and 1418 controls in a large population-based case-control study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between family history of bladder cancer (defined as at least one first-degree family member with bladder cancer or a cancer of any other site). We also evaluated cancer aggregation of specific sites in family members. Participants with a first-degree relative with bladder cancer had nearly double the risk of bladder cancer (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) as those without a family history of bladder cancer. Risk was increased for having a sibling with bladder cancer (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3) compared to no siblings with cancer. Bladder cancer risk was elevated when participants reported a first-degree relative with a history of female genital cancer (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), melanoma (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.6), and tobacco-associated cancer (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.06-1.6). These findings add to evidence of a familial predisposition to bladder cancer. Clarification of the aggregation of bladder cancer in families and with other cancer sites will be of interest as many loci and common polymorphisms related to bladder cancer have yet to be identified in large genomic studies.',\n",
       "  '(0.491)  Background & aims: Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which according to experimental research modulate tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We employed the Mendelian randomization design to test the hypothesis that higher plasma phospholipid AA concentrations are associated with increased risk of 10 site-specific cancers. Methods: Two genetic variants associated with plasma phospholipid concentrations of AA (rs174547 in FADS1 [P = 3.0 × 10-971] and rs16966952 in PDXDC1 [P = 2.4 × 10-10]) in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium were used as genetic instruments. The associations of those variants with cancer were taken from the UK Biobank (n = 367,643), FinnGen consortium (n = 135,638), International Lung Cancer Consortium (n = 27,209), Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (n = 140,254), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (n = 228,951), Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (n = 66,450), and BioBank Japan (n = 212,453). Results: Higher genetically predicted plasma phospholipid AA concentrations were associated with increased risk of colorectal and lung cancer. Results were consistent across data sources and variants. The combined odds ratios per standard deviation increase of AA concentrations were 1.08 (95% CI 1.05\\x961.11; P = 6.3 × 10-8) for colorectal cancer and 1.07 (95%CI 1.05\\x961.10; P = 3.5 × 10-7) for lung cancer. Genetically predicted AA concentrations had a suggestive positive association with esophageal cancer (odds ratio 1.09; 95% CI 1.02\\x961.17; P = 0.016) but were not associated with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, bladder, prostate, breast, uterus, or ovary. Conclusion: These results indicate that AA may be implicated in the development of colorectal and lung cancer and possibly esophageal cancer. Treatments with plasma AA-lowering properties should be evaluated for clinical benefit.',\n",
       "  '(0.463)  Bidirectional gene promoters affect the transcription of two genes, leading to the hypothesis that they should exhibit protection against genetic or epigenetic changes in cancer. Therefore, they provide an excellent opportunity to learn about promoter susceptibility to somatic alteration in tumors. We tested this hypothesis using data from genome-scale DNA methylation (14 cancer types), simple somatic mutation (10 cancer types), and copy number variation profiling (14 cancer types). For DNA methylation, the difference in rank differential methylation between tumor and tumor-adjacent normal matched samples based on promoter type was tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used to compare differences in simple somatic mutations. For copy number alteration, a mixed effects logistic regression model was used. The change in methylation between non-diseased tissues and their tumor counterparts was significantly greater in single compared to bidirectional promoters across all 14 cancer types examined. Similarly, the extent of copy number alteration was greater in single gene compared to bidirectional promoters for all 14 cancer types. Furthermore, among 10 cancer types with available simple somatic mutation data, bidirectional promoters were slightly more susceptible. These results suggest that selective pressures related with specific functional impacts during carcinogenesis drive the susceptibility of promoter regions to somatic alteration.',\n",
       "  \"(0.442)  Although they are critical to models of coordinated care, the relationship and communication between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer specialists throughout the cancer continuum are poorly understood. By using predefined search terms, the authors conducted a systematic review of the literature in 3 databases to examine the relationship and communication between PCPs and cancer specialists. Among 301 articles identified, 35 met all inclusion criteria and were reviewed in-depth. Findings from qualitative, quantitative, and disaggregated mixed-methods studies were integrated using meta-synthesis. Six themes were identified and incorporated into a preliminary conceptual model of the PCP-cancer specialist relationship: 1) poor and delayed communication between PCPs and cancer specialists, 2) cancer specialists' endorsement of a specialist-based model of care, 3) PCPs' belief that they play an important role in the cancer continuum, 4) PCPs' willingness to participate in the cancer continuum, 5) cancer specialists' and PCPs' uncertainty regarding the PCP's oncology knowledge/experience, and 6) discrepancies between PCPs and cancer specialists regarding roles. These data indicate a pervasive need for improved communication, delineation, and coordination of responsibilities between PCPs and cancer specialists. Future interventions aimed at these deficiencies may improve patient and physician satisfaction and cancer care coordination.

In 2010 the Ugandan Ministry of Health launched the Strategic Plan for Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control with the hope of developing cervical cancer policy in Uganda. This study explored the beliefs of senior key informants in Uganda about cervical cancer prevention, the control programme, and the relevance of cervical cancer policy. Methods: We conducted 15 key informant interviews with participants from six organisations across Northern and Central Uganda. Participants were drawn from district local government health departments, St. Mary's Hospital Lacor, Uganda Nurses and Midwifery Council, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Ministry of Health in Kampala, Uganda. The interview recordings were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seven themes emerged relating to the cervical cancer prevention and control programmes in Uganda: (1) policy frameworks for cervical cancer, (2) operationalising cervical cancer prevention and control, (3) financial allocation and alignment, (4) human resources and capability, (5) essential supplies and vaccines, (6) administrative data and resource distribution, and (7) cervical cancer services. Conclusions: The key informants perceive that the lack of a cervical cancer policy in Uganda is hindering cervical cancer prevention and control programmes. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and stakeholders need to work together in coming up with an effective policy framework that will accelerate efforts towards cervical cancer prevention and control in Uganda.\"],\n",

Researchers must choose among a vast array of implementation frameworks (> 60) that guide design and evaluation of implementation and scale-up processes. Therefore, we sought to recommend conceptual frameworks that can be used to design, inform, and evaluate implementation of physical activity (PA) and nutrition interventions at different stages of the program life cycle. We also sought to recommend a minimum data set of implementation outcome and determinant variables (indicators) as well as measures and tools deemed most relevant for PA and nutrition researchers. Methods: We adopted a five-round modified Delphi methodology. For rounds 1, 2, and 3 we administered online surveys to PA and nutrition implementation scientists to generate a rank order list of most commonly used; i) implementation and scale-up frameworks, ii) implementation indicators, and iii) implementation and scale-up measures and tools. Measures and tools were excluded after round 2 as input from participants was very limited. For rounds 4 and 5, we conducted two in-person meetings with an expert group to create a shortlist of implementation and scale-up frameworks, identify a minimum data set of indicators and to discuss application and relevance of frameworks and indicators to the field of PA and nutrition. Results: The two most commonly referenced implementation frameworks were the Framework for Effective Implementation and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We provide the 25 most highly ranked implementation indicators reported by those who participated in rounds 1-3 of the survey. From these, the expert group created a recommended minimum data set of implementation determinants (n = 10) and implementation outcomes (n = 5) and reconciled differences in commonly used terms and definitions. Conclusions: Researchers are confronted with myriad options when conducting implementation and scale-up evaluations. Thus, we identified and prioritized a list of frameworks and a minimum data set of indicators that have potential to improve the quality and consistency of evaluating implementation and scale-up of PA and nutrition interventions.

       "  '(0.545)  Background: Models, theories, and frameworks (MTFs) provide the foundation for a cumulative science of implementation, reflecting a shared, evolving understanding of various facets of implementation. One under-represented aspect in implementation MTFs is how intersecting social factors and systems of power and oppression can shape implementation. There is value in enhancing how MTFs in implementation research and practice account for these intersecting factors. Given the large number of MTFs, we sought to identify exemplar MTFs that represent key implementation phases within which to embed an intersectional perspective. Methods: We used a five-step process to prioritize MTFs for enhancement with an intersectional lens. We mapped 160 MTFs to three previously prioritized phases of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) framework. Next, 17 implementation researchers/practitioners, MTF experts, and intersectionality experts agreed on criteria for prioritizing MTFs within each KTA phase. The experts used a modified Delphi process to agree on an exemplar MTF for each of the three prioritized KTA framework phases. Finally, we reached consensus on the final MTFs and contacted the original MTF developers to confirm MTF versions and explore additional insights. Results: We agreed on three criteria when prioritizing MTFs: acceptability (mean = 3.20, SD = 0.75), applicability (mean = 3.82, SD = 0.72), and usability (median = 4.00, mean = 3.89, SD = 0.31) of the MTF. The top-rated MTFs were the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care for the \\x91Identify the problem\\x92 phase (mean = 4.57, SD = 2.31), the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for the \\x91Assess barriers/facilitators to knowledge use\\x92 phase (mean = 5.79, SD = 1.12), and the Behaviour Change Wheel for the \\x91Select, tailor, implement interventions\\x92 phase (mean = 6.36, SD = 1.08). Conclusions: Our interdisciplinary team engaged in a rigorous process to reach consensus on MTFs reflecting specific phases of the implementation process and prioritized each to serve as an exemplar in which to embed intersectional approaches. The resulting MTFs correspond with specific phases of the KTA framework, which itself may be useful for those seeking particular MTFs for particular KTA phases. This approach also provides a template for how other implementation MTFs could be similarly considered in the future. Trial registration: Open Science Framework Registration: osf.io/qgh64.',\n",

Aims: To empirically examine the role of middle managers relevant to innovation implementation and how middle managers experience the implementation process. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using the methods of grounded theory. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with middle managers (N\\xa0=\\xa015) in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. Participants were purposively sampled, based on their involvement in implementation initiatives and to obtain variation in manager characteristics. Data were collected and analyzed concurrently, using an inductive constant comparative approach. Data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation was reached. Results: Middle managers see themselves as being responsible for making implementation happen in their programs and services. As a result, they carry out five roles related to implementation: planner, coordinator, facilitator, motivator, and evaluator. However, the data also revealed two determinants of middle managers' role in implementation, which they must negotiate to fulfill their specific implementation roles and activities: (1) They perform many other roles and responsibilities within their organizations, both clinical and managerial in nature, and (2) they have limited decision-making power with respect to implementation and must work within the parameters set by upper levels of the organization. Linking Evidence to Action: Middle managers play an important role in translating adoption decisions into on-the-ground implementation. Optimizing their capacity to fulfill this role may be key to improving innovation implementation in healthcare organizations.\",\n",

Methods Four hundred and thirty-three patients from the ICONA cohort, starting first-line ART after the year 2000, were analysed. Pre-ART HIV DNA was quantified with the modified COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test and normalized by CD4+ T cells. Linear correlation between pre-ART HIV DNA and other continuous markers (HIV RNA, CD4 count, markers of inflammation and coagulation) at baseline was evaluated by means of Pearson correlation coefficient and a linear regression model. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were used to study the association between pre-ART HIV DNA and time to VIRO-immunoclinical events. Results Pre-ART HIV DNA [median (IQR): 10 \\x80 702 (3397-36 \\x80 632) copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells] was correlated with pre-ART HIV RNA [R 2 = +0.44, (P < 0.0001)], CD4+ T cells [R 2 = '0.58, (P < 0.0001)] and CD4/CD8 ratio [R 2 = '0.48, (P < 0.0001)], while weaker correlations were observed with CD8+ T cells (R 2 = '0.20, P = 0.01), IL-6 (R 2 = +0.16, P = 0.002) and soluble CD14 (R 2 = +0.09, P = 0.05). Patients with higher pre-ART HIV DNA showed lower rate and delayed VIROlogical response (defined as HIV RNA =50 copies/mL), compared with those having lower HIV DNA (67.2% for >10 \\x80 000, 81.1% for 1000-10 \\x80 000 and 86.4% for 10-1000 copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells; P = 0.0004). Higher pre-ART HIV DNA was also correlated with increased risk of VIROlogical rebound (defined as HIV RNA >50 copies/mL) by 24 months (17.2% for >10 \\x80 000, 7.4% for 1000-10 \\x80 000 and 4.3% for 10-1000 copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells; P = 0.0048). Adjusted HRs of all VIROlogical rebound definitions confirmed these findings (P = 0.02).

       "  '(0.638)  Public health messages shape how the world understands the HIV epidemic. Considerable inequalities remain in HIV care continuum indicators by subpopulation and geography (eg, highest infection and mortality burden among men who have sex with men and people who live in sub-Saharan Africa). Health equity-focused approaches are necessary in this next decade to close gaps in the HIV epidemic. Between 1981 and 1989, HIV messages triggered fear and victim blaming, and highlighted behaviours of a few marginalised groups as deviant. Between 1990 and 1999, messages signalled that HIV was a growing challenge for the world and required multisector approaches that addressed structural drivers of inequality. Between 2000 and 2009, messages highlighted universal testing, while advances in HIV testing made these messages easier for individuals to respond to than in previous decades. Currently, messages signal that ending HIV is possible, people can live productive lives with HIV, and transmission to people without HIV can be eliminated. Public health messaging about the HIV epidemic has evolved substantially over the past 40 years. Future HIV messaging should be driven by health equity principles that include an increased representation of key populations in message design and dissemination, transparency of funding, and communicating any impact that campaigns have had on closing health inequalities.',\n",

Comparisons of alpha and beta diversity between HIV+ and HIV- groups were performed and key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) distinguishing the two groups were identified using the Boruta feature selection after Random Forest Analysis. Results: PLWH demonstrated significantly reduced Shannon diversity compared with HIV- volunteers (1.82±0.10 vs. 2.20±0.073, p=0.0024). This was primarily driven by a reduction in bacterial richness (23.29±2.75 for PLWH and 46.04±3.716 for HIV-, p<0.0001). Phyla distribution was significantly altered among PLWH, with an increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p=0.0003) and a decrease in Bacteroidetes (p=0.0068) and Firmicutes (p=0.0002). Six discriminative OTUs were found to distinguish PLWH from HIV- volunteers, aligning to Veillonellaceae, Fusobacterium, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Campylobacter. Conclusions: Compared to HIV- controls, PLWH's SAE microbiome is marked by reduced bacterial diversity and richness with significant differences in community composition.\",\n",
       "  '(0.589)  Objectives: Viral phylogenetics revealed two patterns of HIV-1 spread among MSM in Quebec. While most HIV-1 strains (n = 2011) were associated with singleton/small clusters (cluster size 1-4), 30 viral lineages formed large networks (cluster size 20-140), contributing to 42% of diagnoses between 2011 and 2015. Herein, tissue culture selections ascertained if large cluster lineages possessed higher replicative fitness than singleton/small cluster isolates, allowing for viral escape from integrase inhibitors.Methods: Primary HIV-1 isolates from large 20+ cluster (n = 11) or singleton/small cluster (n = 6) networks were passaged in vitro in escalating concentrations of dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine for 24-36 weeks. Sanger and deep sequencing assessed genotypic changes under selective drug pressure.Results: Large cluster HIV-1 isolates selected for resistance to dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine faster than HIV-1 strains forming small clusters. With dolutegravir, large cluster HIV-1 variants acquired solitary R263K (n = 7), S153Y (n = 1) or H51Y (n = 1) mutations as the dominant quasi-species within 8-12 weeks as compared with small cluster lineages where R263K (n = 1/6), S153Y (1/6) or WT species (4/6) were observed after 24 weeks. Interestingly, dolutegravir-associated mutations compromised viral replicative fitness, precluding escalations in concentrations beyond 5-10 nM. With elvitegravir, large cluster variants more rapidly acquired first mutations (T66I, A92G, N155H or S147G) by week 8 followed by sequential accumulation of multiple mutations leading to viral escape (>10 µM) by week 24.Conclusions: Further studies are needed to understand virological features of large cluster viruses that may favour their transmissibility, replicative competence and potential to escape selective antiretroviral drug pressure.'],\n",
       " ['(0.457)  Background: Evidence-Based Medicine is built on the premise that clinicians can be more confident when their decisions are grounded in high-quality evidence. Furthermore, evidence from studies involving patient-oriented outcomes is preferred when making decisions about tests or treatments. Ideally, the findings of relevant and valid trials should be stable over time, that is, unlikely to be reversed in subsequent research. Objective: To evaluate the stability of evidence from trials relevant to primary healthcare and to identify study characteristics associated with their reversal. Methods: We studied synopses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from 2002 to 2005 as \"Daily POEMs\"(Patient Oriented Evidence that Matters). The initial evidence (E1) from these POEMs (2002-2005) was compared with the updated evidence (E2) on that same topic in a summary resource (DynaMed 2019). Two physician-raters independently categorized each POEM-RCT as (i) reversed when E1 = E2, or as (ii) not reversed, when E1 = E2. For all \"Evidence Reversals\"(E1 = E2), we assessed the direction of change in the evidence. Results: We evaluated 408 POEMs on RCTs. Of those, 35 (9%; 95% confidence interval [6-12]) were identified as reversed, 359 (88%) were identified as not reversed, and 14 (3%) were indeterminate. On average, this represents about 2 evidence reversals per annum for POEMs about RCTs. Conclusions: Over 12-17 years, 9% of RCTs summarized as POEMs are reversed. Information alerting services that apply strict criteria for relevance and validity of clinical information are likely to identify RCTs whose findings are stable over time.',\n",

This study examines the characteristics of evidence that informed changes from I statements to definitive recommendations, including NIH's role as a funder. Methods: A total of 11 USPSTF Insufficient Evidence statements that were changed between 2010 and 2019 were assessed. Study designs, bibliometric influence, and funding sources for scientific articles cited in USPSTF evidence reviews were characterized for each I statement. Data were analyzed in 2019\\x962020. Results: Most I statements (82%) changed to a B grade; an average of 8.4 years elapsed between issuing the I statement and releasing the definitive recommendation. An average of 63 (range=19-253) articles were included in each USPSTF evidence review. NIH support was cited in 28.8% of articles, on average. The proportion of NIH-funded articles reporting RCT designs was similar to that of non\\x96NIH-funded articles (64.5% vs 59.5%). A higher proportion of NIH-funded articles were rated good quality for study design (39.0%) than the proportion of non\\x96NIH-funded articles (24.4%).

       "  '(0.422)  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about clinical preventive services. The USPSTF examines chains of direct and indirect evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of a clinical preventive service. Missing links across the chains of evidence reflect gaps in the research. Evidence gaps can occur for preventive services that receive a letter grade recommendation and those that receive an I statement (insufficient evidence). This article describes the types of evidence gaps that the USPSTF encounters across its various recommendations and how the USPSTF identifies and communicates these gaps to researchers and policymakers, who can help generate the needed evidence. Common types of evidence gaps include limited evidence in primary care settings and populations, a lack of appropriate health outcomes, limited evidence linking behavior change to health outcomes, and a lack of evidence for effective preventive services in diverse populations. The USPSTF annual report to Congress focuses on the evidence gaps of new recommendations from the past year and is sent to leading research funding agencies. The Office of Disease Prevention at NIH uses this report to help direct future funding opportunities that may address these evidence gaps. The USPSTF plays a critical role in highlighting the information needed to advance the science to optimize the use of clinical preventive services in primary care.',\n",
       "  '(0.406)  Background: In Canada, cost prohibits access to emergency contraception (EC) which may assist to prevent unintended pregnancy. The drug, ulipristal acetate (UPA-EC), is more clinically effective and cost-effective than the prior standard levonorgestrel (LNG-EC). We analyzed provincial EC subsidization policies and examined underlying decision-making processes. Methods: We undertook documentary analysis of provincial EC subsidization policies in publicly available drug formularies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants to explore the processes underlying current policies. Results: Quebec is the only province to subsidize UPA-EC, whilst all ten provinces subsidize LNG-EC. As such, provincial EC subsidization policies do not align with the latest UPA-EC evidence. Interviews revealed that evidence was valued in the policymaking process and formulary decisions were made through interdisciplinary consensus. Conclusions: We identify a gap between EC subsidization policies and the latest evidence. Institutional structures affect policies reflecting evolving evidence. Increasing interdisciplinary mechanisms may encourage evidence-based policies.',\n",

Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network\\'s \"absorptive capacity\" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework. Methods: The project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network\\'s and subnetwork\\'s effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes.

       " ['(0.437)  BACKGROUND: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) improves survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), yet BCPR rates remain low. It is unknown whether BCPR delivery disparities exist based on victim gender. We measured BCPR rates by gender in private and public environments, hypothesizing that females would be less likely than males to receive BCPR in public settings, with an associated difference in survival to hospital discharge. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from adult, nontraumatic OHCA events within the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium registry (2011-2015). Using logistic regression, we modeled the likelihood of receiving BCPR by gender, including patient-level variables, stratified by location. A cohort of 19<U+2009>331 OHCAs was assessed. Mean age was 64±17 years, and 63% (12<U+2009>225/19<U+2009>331) were male. Overall, 37% of OHCA victims received bystander CPR. In public locations, 39% (272/694) of females and 45% (1170/2600) of males received BCPR ( P<0.01), whereas in private settings, 35% (2198/6328) of females and 36% (3364/9449) of males received BCPR ( P=NS). Among public OHCAs, males had significantly increased odds of receiving BCPR compared with females (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53; P=0.01); this was not the case in the private setting (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-1.01; P=NS). Controlling for site, age, and race, BCPR was significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.54-1.85; P<0.01); in this model, males had 29% increased odds of survival compared with females (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Males had an increased likelihood of receiving BCPR compared with females in public. BCPR improved survival to discharge, with greater survival among males compared with females.',\n",

We conducted a matched case-control study using administrative databases to evaluate the association between the rate of infections and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2-14 years from Ontario, Canada and we used a validated approach to measure infections. In 1600 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 16 000 matched cancer-free controls aged 2-14 years, having >2 infections/year increased the odds of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 43% (odds ratio = 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.81) compared to children with =0.25 infections/year. Having >2 respiratory infections/year increased odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 28% (odds ratio =1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.57) compared to children with =0.25 respiratory infections/year. Having an invasive infection increased the odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 72% (odds ratio =1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31-2.26). Having an infection between the age of 1-1.5 years increased the odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 20% (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.39).

Results: Overall, 2440 nurses reported 3327 pregnancies, with 550 (17%) ended in miscarriages. Twelve percent of nurses self-reported currently handling AD and 28% previously handling AD. Compared with nurses who never handled AD, nurses who handled AD at baseline had an adjusted HR of miscarriage of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97\\x961.64). This association was stronger after 12-weeks gestation (HR=2.39 [95% CI, 1.13\\x965.07]).

       "  '(0.399)  Swimmers have a high prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which may be associated with repeated exposure to chlorinated pool water. The eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) test is used to diagnose EIB; however, it fails to replicate the environmental conditions experienced by swimmers. The relationship between the composition of the EVH inspired gas and the development of EIB from swim exercise remains unclear. Purpose This study aimed to compare the bronchoconstrictive effect of a chlorinated inspirate EVH test and swim test to a laboratory-based EVH test in swimmers. Methods Fifteen collegiate swimmers (n = 5 male, n = 10 female; 21 ± 2 yr) completed 3 d of testing in pseudorandom order; a standard EVH test (EVHL), a pool air EVH test (EVHCl), and a swimming test (Swim). Spirometry was measured at baseline, and 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after each test. Results EVHL elicited a forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) fall index of -9.7% ± 6.4% compared with -6.6% ± 9.2% and -3.0% ± 7.5% after EVHCl and Swim, respectively (P < 0.05). Using Bland-Altman analysis, we found good agreement between EVHL and EVHCl (bias = -2.8, r = 0.79; P < 0.05) with poor agreement between EVHL and Swim (bias = -6.7, r = 0.20) and between EVHCl and Swim (bias = -3.9, r = 0.50; both P < 0.05). Forced expired flow between 25% and 75% lung volume and peak expired flow were significantly reduced by the EVHL compared with the EVHCl and Swim tests (P < 0.05). Conclusions EVHL elicits a greater forced expired volume in 1-s fall index compared with EVHCl and Swim. The unique aquatic environment of swimmers potentially protects against bronchoconstriction and should be considered in the determination of EIB.',\n",

In this study, we compared the addition of abiraterone, docetaxel, bisphosphonate, celecoxib or combinations to standard ADT vs. ADT alone for patients with mHSPC in terms of overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS), and adverse events. Methods: We searched PubMed and performed a network meta-analysis to generate probabilistic inferences and provide efficacy rankings in terms of posterior hazard ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI), surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), probability better than competing treatments, and probability best. Results: Seven trials were included (LATITUTE, STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15, ZAPCA, CALGB 90202, and MRC PR05).

Members of the national MyVoice Text Message Cohort (aged 14\\x9624) were surveyed from April 24 to April 30, 2020, through an open-ended text message poll. Responses were inductively coded and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Of the 944 youth who responded (response rate = 81.2%), 95% self-reported social distancing. However, 62% recalled instances of themselves or others breaking the guidelines and 19% expressed misconceptions about the rules. Notably, 14% of youth said they would encourage their friends to social distance by telling them it will accelerate a return to normal life. Feelings of social isolation were the most frequently cited (55%) negative impact of social distancing. Overall, responses from youth indicate significant variation in the interpretation of social distancing guidelines. Public health communications may need to address several critical misconceptions which impact the social distancing behaviors of youth. Further, safe methods for youth to interact with peers during periods of social distancing are necessary to prevent mental health impacts and to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines.',\n",

Social innovation, a community-engaged process that links social change and health improvement, may be useful for helping to end the HIV epidemic in Asia. A scoping review to examine social innovation strategies in sexual health for the Asian region was conducted. The research identified focused on three types of social innovation: (1) microfinance; (2) social entrepreneurship; and (3) social enterprise. Microfinance provides financial opportunities (e.g. banking services, job opportunities) to spur local entrepreneurship and healthier behaviours. Social entrepreneurship uses business principles and tools (e.g. crowdsourcing, human-centred design) to improve health. Social enterprise is a business with a social mission. Further research is needed to measure the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of social innovation strategies in improving HIV services.',\n",
       "  '(0.494)  Physical distancing practices during the COVID-19 global pandemic contributed to a high degree of social isolation among older adults. To reduce loneliness and other ill effects of social isolation, public health experts recommended outdoor social gathering, with physical distancing. Adopting a case study approach, we explored how social aspects of group outdoor health walks (GOHWs) mitigate social isolation for older adults and improve individual social wellbeing. We used semi-structured interviews to understand the experiences of social isolation and social relationships in nine older (50\\x9680 s) adults participating in a GOHW in Scotland, United Kingdom (UK). Verbatim transcripts were analysed through an iterative process of thematic analysis carried out by an interdisciplinary team of qualitative researchers from environmental psychology, medicine, and geography. Themes provide insight into the social dimensions of GOHWs, the mediating effects of social experiences, and the contribution these make to individual social wellbeing. GOHWs provide opportunities to be part of a group and attend to the needs of inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Being part of the group walk fosters casual interpersonal interactions through spontaneous mixing during and after the walk. This programmatic structure counters loneliness, en-genders pleasurable anticipation of regular contact with others, supports physical activity, and fosters group cohesion. These in turn contribute to individual social wellbeing, including expanding social networks, meaningful relationships, a sense of belonging, and acting on empathy for others. GOWHs may be beneficial for mitigation of social isolation as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings were used to propose a conceptual model to parse social constructs and inform selection or development of quantitative social measures for future studies of nature-based interventions such as GOHWs.',\n",

Methods: A cost analysis was performed to estimate the annual costs of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD for ESRD patients from both the health service provider's and societal perspectives. Empirical data on healthcare resource use, patients' out-of-pocket costs, time spent on transportation and dialysis by ESRD patients and time spent by caregivers were analysed. All costs were expressed in Hong Kong year 2017 dollars. Results: Analysis was based on 402 ESRD patients on maintenance dialysis (PD: 189; hospital-based HD: 170; and nocturnal home HD: 43). From the perspective of the healthcare provider, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual direct medical costs in the initial year (mean ± SD) (hospital-based HD = $400 057 ± 62 822; PD = $118 467 ± 15 559; nocturnal home HD = $223 358 ± 18 055; P < 0.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $360 924 ± 63 014; PD = $80 796 ± 15 820; nocturnal home HD = $87 028 ± 9059; P < 0.001). From the societal perspective, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual costs in the initial year (hospital-based HD = $452 151 ± 73 327; PD = $189 191 ± 61 735; nocturnal home HD = $242 038 ± 28 281; P < 0.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $413 017 ± 73 501; PD = $151 520 ± 60 353; nocturnal home HD = $105 708 ± 23 853; P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study quantified the economic burden of ESRD patients, and assessed the annual healthcare and societal costs in the initial and second years of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD in Hong Kong. From both perspectives, PD is cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD, except that nocturnal home HD has the lowest cost in the second year of treatment from the societal perspective.

Attributable bronchiolitis costs were $2,765 (95%CI: $2735\\x962,794) vs $111 (95%CI: $102\\x96121) in the initial 10 days post index date, $4,695 (95%CI: $4,589\\x964,800) vs $910 (95%CI: $847\\x96973) in the initial 180 days and $1,158 (95%CI: $1,104\\x961213) vs $639 (95%CI: $599\\x96679) during days 181\\x96360. Mean 1-year bronchiolitis costs were higher in infants <3 months old [$5,536 (95%CI: $5,216\\x965,856)], those with co-morbidities [$17,530 (95%CI: $14,683\\x9620,377)] and with low birthweight [$5,509 (95%CI: $4,927\\x966,091)]. Conclusions Compared to no bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis incurs five-time and two-time higher healthcare costs within the initial and subsequent six-months, respectively. Most expenses occur in the initial 10 days and relate to hospitalization.',\n",
       "  '(0.427)  Purpose: To compare the yearly cost involved per patient in the use of magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) and traditional growing rods (TGRs) in the treatment of early onset scoliosis (EOS) and to assess the overall cost burden of MCGR with reference to patient and health-care infrastructure. Methods: For a hypothetical case of a 5-year-old girl with a diagnosis of EOS, a decision-tree model using TreeAge Software was developed to simulate annual health state transitions and compare the 8-year accumulative direct, indirect, and total cost among the four groups: (1) dual MCGRs with exchange every 2 years, (2) dual MCGRs with exchange every 3 years, (3) TGR with surgical distraction every year, and (4) TGR with surgical distraction every 6 months. Base-case values and ranges of clinical parameters reflecting complication rate after each type of surgical distraction were determined from a review of literature and expert opinion. Government gazette and expert opinion provided cost estimation of growing rods, surgeries, surgical complications, and routine follow-up. Microsimulation of 1000 individuals was conducted to test the variation in total direct costs (in 2016 Hong Kong dollars (HKD)) between individuals, and estimated the standard deviations of total direct costs for each group. Results: Over the projected treatment period, indirect costs incurred by patients and family were higher for the MCGR as compared to the TGR. However, the total costs incurred by MCGR groups (group 1: HKD164k; group 2: HKD138k) were lower than those incurred by TGR groups (group 3: HKD191k; group 4: HKD290k). Although the accumulative costs of three groups (TGR with distraction every year and MCGR replacing every 2 and 3 years) were approaching each other in the first 2 years after initial implantation, at year 3 the accumulative cost of MCGR exchange every 2 years was HKD36k more than the yearly TGR surgery due to the cost of implant exchange. The cost incurred by both the MCGR groups was less than that incurred by the TGR groups from year 4 to skeletal maturity. Conclusions: The use of dual MCGRs, regardless of its 2-or 3-year exchange, was only cost saving and less expensive than the dual TGRs for EOS treatment from the fourth year of continuous treatment. Despite higher patient-related costs during MCGR treatment, it is important to consider the reduced risks and mental burden suffered by these children during repeat surgeries. With improved knowledge of the costs associated with long-term MCGR use, better constructed cost-effectiveness studies can be performed in the future.'],\n",
       " ['(0.571)  Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour \\x96 whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions \\x96 education, regulation and material incentivisation \\x96 largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context-dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.',\n",
       "  '(0.508)  Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a country\\x92s health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions. Results Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 80\\x9695) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 90\\x9697), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89\\x96100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 84\\x9693). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen. Conclusion Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed.',\n",
       "  '(0.444)  Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are common yet preventable. Healthcare professional behaviours, such as reducing unnecessary catheter use, are key for preventing CAUTI. Previous research has focused on identifying gaps in the national response to CAUTI in multiple settings in England. This study aimed to identify how national interventions could be optimised. We conducted a multi-method study comprising: a rapid review of research on interventions to reduce CAUTI; a behavioural analysis of effective research interventions compared to national interventions; and a stakeholder focus group and survey to identify the most promising options for optimising interventions. We identified 37 effective research interventions, mostly conducted in United States secondary care. A behavioural analysis of these interventions identified 39 intervention components as possible ways to optimise national interventions. Seven intervention components were prioritised by stakeholders. These included: checklists for discharge/admission to wards; information for patients and relatives about the pros/cons of catheters; setting and profession specific guidelines; standardised nationwide computer-based documentation; promotion of alternatives to catheter use; CAUTI champions; and bladder scanners. By combining research evidence, behavioural analysis and stakeholder feedback, we identified how national interventions to reduce CAUTI could be improved. The seven prioritised components should be considered for future implementation.',\n",
       "  '(0.435)  Background: Herd immunity, or community immunity, occurs when susceptible people in a population are indirectly protected from infection thanks to the pervasiveness of immunity within the population. In this study, we aimed to systematically review interventions designed to communicate what community immunity is and how community immunity works to members of the general public. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles describing interventions with or without evaluations. We then conducted web searches with Google to identify interventions lacking associated publications. We extracted data about the target population of the interventions, the interventions themselves (e.g., did they describe what community immunity is, and how it works), any effects of evaluated interventions, and synthesized data narratively. Results: We identified 32 interventions: 11 interventions described in peer-reviewed articles and 21 interventions without associated articles. Of the 32 interventions, 5 described what community immunity is, 6 described the mechanisms of how community immunity occurs and 21 described both. Fourteen of the 32 addressed infectious diseases in general while the other 13 addressed one or more specific diseases. Twelve of the 32 interventions used videos, 7 used interactive simulations and 6 used questionnaires. Ten of the 11 peer-reviewed articles described studies evaluating at least one effect of the interventions. Within these 10, 4/4 reported increased knowledge, 3/5 reported shifts of attitudes in favour of vaccination, 2/5 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Of 3 studies evaluating interventions specifically about community immunity, 2 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Conclusions: A compelling benefit of vaccination exists at the population level in the form of community immunity. Identifying ways to optimally communicate about this benefit may be important, because some evidence suggests that effective communication about community immunity can increase vaccination intentions.',\n",
       "  '(0.427)  Group-based interventions are widely used to promote health-related behaviour change. While processes operating in groups have been extensively described, it remains unclear how behaviour change is generated in group-based health-related behaviour-change interventions. Understanding how such interventions facilitate change is important to guide intervention design and process evaluations. We employed a mixed-methods approach to identify, map and define change processes operating in group-based behaviour-change interventions. We reviewed multidisciplinary literature on group dynamics, taxonomies of change technique categories, and measures of group processes. Using weight-loss groups as an exemplar, we also reviewed qualitative studies of participants\\x92 experiences and coded transcripts of 38 group sessions from three weight-loss interventions. Finally, we consulted group participants, facilitators and researchers about our developing synthesis of findings. The resulting \\x91Mechanisms of Action in Group-based Interventions\\x92 (MAGI) framework comprises six overarching categories: (1) group intervention design features, (2) facilitation techniques, (3) group dynamic and development processes, (4) inter-personal change processes, (5) selective intra-personal change processes operating in groups, and (6) contextual influences. The framework provides theoretical explanations of how change occurs in group-based behaviour-change interventions and can be applied to optimise their design and delivery, and to guide evaluation, facilitator training and further research.'],\n",

We studied associations between heat and all-cause mortality to estimate heat threshold(s) affecting health, and examine other affecting dimensions. We conducted time-series analysis with daily maximum temperature and all-cause mortality data of Bhubaneswar city (March\\x96July, 2007\\x962017), and explored their interactions. Mortality risks rose when daily maximum temperatures were >36.2°C (lower threshold), and even more when >40.5°C (upper threshold). Every degree above36.2°C increased the mortality risk by 2% (mortality rate ratio: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01, 1.03). The effects of maximum temperature increased on days when minimum temperatures were >25.6°C (median). The effect of heat was immediate and lasted for 0\\x961 day with no lagged effect. Two temperature thresholds with varying mortality risks provided an opportunity for a graded heat warning system. The accentuation of the deleterious effects of heat by the higher minimum temperature calls for its inclusion in the heat warning system in future.',\n",

The nationally-representative Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Nutrition 2004 was linked with the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database and the Discharge Abstract Database (2004-2011). Outcomes were all-cause mortality and CVD incidence and mortality. There were 1,722 mortality cases within 115,566 person-years of follow-up (median (IQR) of 7.48 (7.22-7.70) years). There was no statistically significant association between sodium density or energy from saturated fat and all-cause mortality or CVD events for all models investigated. The association of usual percentage of energy from added sugars and all-cause mortality was significant in the base model with participants consuming 11.47% of energy from added sugars having 1.34 (95% CI: 1.01-1.77) times higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to those consuming 4.17% of energy from added sugars. Overall, our results did not find statistically significant associations between the three nutrients and risk of all-cause mortality or CVD events at the population level in Canada. Large-scale linked national nutrition datasets may not have the discrimination to identify prospective impacts of nutrients on health measures.',\n",
       "  '(0.515)  What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks? Background: Following a century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking. Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images. Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing ~68.9% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors. Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age. Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions.',\n",
       "  '(0.473)  Background and Purpose: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent epidemiological data on incidence, mortality, and association with oral anticoagulation are needed. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients (=18 years) with ICH in the entire population of Ontario, Canada (April 1, 2009-March 30, 2019). We captured outcome data using linked health administrative databases. The primary outcome was mortality during hospitalization, as well as at 1 year following ICH. Results: We included 20 738 patients with ICH. Mean (SD) age was 71.3 (15.1) years, and 52.6% of patients were male. Overall incidence of ICH throughout the study period was 19.1/100 000 person-years and did not markedly change over the study period. In-hospital and 1-year mortality were high (32.4% and 45.4%, respectively). Mortality at 2 years was 49.5%. Only 14.5% of patients were discharged home independently. Over the study period, both in-hospital and 1-year mortality reduced by 10.4% (37.5% to 27.1%, P<0.001) and 7.6% (50.0% to 42.4%, P<0.001), respectively. Use of oral anticoagulation was associated with both in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI, 1.26-1.49]) and 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.25]) following ICH. Conclusions: Both short- A nd long-term mortality have decreased in the past decade. Most survivors from ICH are likely to be discharged to long-term care. Oral anticoagulation is associated with both short- A nd long-term mortality following ICH. These findings highlight the devastating nature of ICH, but also identify significant improvement in outcomes over time.',\n",

Young men struggle to find jobs as labor migrants, while some young women find work in villages. These women assume provider roles for their families that are reminiscent of longstanding normative masculine achievements. They also use their income to achieve relative independence. Although many households depend on working women, they nevertheless attract criticism. Women mobilize a discourse of \\x93human rights\\x94 to defend their position in these conflicts, even as men argue that \\x93human rights\\x94 enable women\\x92s wayward behaviour. Drawing on fieldwork in the Eastern Cape, this article argues that working women provoke controversy because of how they trouble gendered meanings attached to work, domesticity, and social reproduction. I show that although they challenge the patriarchal domestic order through lifestyle choices and overt appeals to the \\x93right\\x94 to remain single, the strategies that working women deploy to manage conflicting expectations and a heavy workload also reproduce patriarchal domestic hierarchies. In so doing, they further exclude young men from social reproduction.

This project has contributed evidence to the discussion of women\\x92s experiences of subjectivity in the discursive landscape of birth, while uncovering previously unacknowledged sites of resistance.

       "  '(0.525)  An equal number of women and men are now graduating from dental school, but women dentists have lower income and are less likely to achieve positions of leadership, including within dental academia. Materials and Methods: Demographic information and academic rank were obtained for all faculty at the eight dental schools who received the most funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2017. Years since dental school graduation, total number of PubMed-indexed citations, first- and last-author publications, and H-index were determined for each faculty member. Gender differences in productivity and advancement were evaluated. Results: Of 702 faculty members, 36.5% were female; only 24.4% of full professors were women. Men had significantly higher numbers of publications (30.2 [95% confidence interval [CI, 28.6-39.5] vs. 20.4 [95% CI 16.3-24.6], p = 0.02) and higher H-index (8.2 [95% CI 7.1-9.1] vs. 4.7 [95% CI 3.9-5.5], p < 0.0001). Women had graduated more recently than their male colleagues at all levels of academic advancement (overall 22.83 years [95% CI 21.29-24.39] vs. 30.19 years [95% CI 28.84-31.55], p < 0.0001). When corrected for academic productivity and years since graduation, the association between gender and academic rank was not significant. Conclusions: Women are underrepresented at each academic rank except instructor; however, women may advance more quickly than their male counterparts. Increasing scholarship and mentorship opportunities for female faculty members may help improve gender equity in dental academia.',\n",

Obstetric and bariatric professional societies recommend that women avoid pregnancy for 12-18 months postoperatively due to concern for increased pregnancy risks, and that providers should counsel women about these recommendations and their contraceptive options. However, knowledge about women's experience with perioperative counseling and postoperative contraceptive use is limited. Objective: We sought to: (1) determine prevalence of perioperative contraceptive and pregnancy interval discussions among women who have recently undergone bariatric surgery; and (2) describe postoperative contraceptive use within the first year of surgery in this population. Study Design: We performed a cross-sectional study of US women, aged 18-45 years and recruited through Facebook, who underwent bariatric surgery within the last 24 months. Results: We enrolled 363 geographically diverse women. Three-quarters recalled perioperative pregnancy or contraceptive discussions, the majority with a bariatric provider. Half felt it was \\x93very important\\x94 to discuss these issues perioperatively, and 41% of those who reported discussions wished they had had more. Of the 66% of women who reported using contraception in the first 12 months postoperatively, 27% used oral contraceptives and 26% used an intrauterine device. One third of contraceptive users who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a combined restrictive-malabsorptive procedure, were using oral contraceptives. Perioperative contraceptive or pregnancy discussions were independently associated with increased postoperative contraceptive use (odds ratios, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5\\x964.3, P <.001). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of women who had undergone bariatric surgery reported having had no perioperative pregnancy or contraception counseling, and many women who had felt the discussions were insufficient. Those who had had perioperative discussions were more likely to use contraception postoperatively. Reproductive-aged women should be routinely counseled perioperatively about pregnancy and contraception in the context of their reproductive desires, so they can make informed decisions about perioperative pregnancy prevention and contraceptive method use.\",\n",

Objective Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of sterilization for women with physical/sensory disabilities, and compare this to the prevalence for women without disabilities. We also compared use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods between women with and without disabilities. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth 2011\\x962013, a population-based survey of U.S. women aged 15\\x9644. Bivariate comparisons between women with and without disabilities by female sterilization and LARC use were conducted using chi-square tests. Using logistic regression, we estimated the odds of female sterilization based upon disability status. Results Women with physical/sensory disabilities accounted for 9.3% of the total sample (N = 4966). Among women with disabilities only, 28.2% had undergone female sterilization, representing 1.2 million women nationally. LARC use was lower among women with disabilities than those without disabilities (5.4%, 9.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, insurance, marital status, parity, and self-reported health, women with disabilities had higher odds of sterilization (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03, 1.79).

       " [\"(0.546)  Objective Depression is a potential risk factor for developing IBD. This association may be related to GI symptoms occurring before diagnosis. We aimed to determine whether depression, adjusted for pre-existing GI symptoms, is associated with subsequent IBD. Design We conducted a nested case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink identifying incident cases of UC and Crohn's disease (CD) from 1998 to 2016. Controls without IBD were matched for age and sex. We measured exposure to prevalent depression 4.5-5.5 years before IBD diagnosis. We created two sub-groups with prevalent depression based on whether individuals had reported GI symptoms before the onset of depression. We used conditional logistic regression to derive ORs for the risk of IBD depending on depression status. Results We identified 10 829 UC cases, 4531 CD cases and 15 360 controls. There was an excess of prevalent depression 5 years before IBD diagnosis relative to controls (UC: 3.7% vs 2.7%, CD 3.7% vs 2.9%). Individuals with GI symptoms prior to the diagnosis of depression had increased adjusted risks of developing UC and CD compared with those without depression (UC: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.79; CD: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.92). Individuals with depression alone had similar risks of UC and CD to those without depression (UC: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; CD: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.38). Conclusions Depression, in the absence of prior GI symptoms, is not associated with subsequent development of IBD. However, depression with GI symptoms should prompt investigation for IBD.\",\n",
       "  '(0.502)  Aims: Reflux symptoms are highly prevalent and non-specific; hence, in the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy referral decisions are challenging. This study evaluated whether a non-endoscopic Cytosponge could detect benign oesophageal pathologies and thus have future potential in triaging patients with persistent symptoms. Methods and results: Two complementary cohorts were recruited: (i) patients with reflux symptoms and no prior endoscopy (n = 409), and (ii) patients with reflux symptoms referred for endoscopy (n = 411). All patients were investigated using the Cytosponge and endoscopy. Significant epithelial inflammation was present in 130 (16%) Cytosponge samples, 32 of which had ulcer slough. Candida and significant inflammation was detected in a further 22 (2.3%) cases; epithelial infiltration with >15 eosinophils/high-power field reflecting possible eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) in five (0.6%); and viral inclusions suggestive of herpes oesophagitis in one (0.1%). No significant pathology was detected in the majority, 662 (81%), of Cytosponge samples. Cytosponge and endoscopy findings were in agreement in 574 (70%) cases, in 165 (67%) of the discordant cases one investigation showed mild inflammation while the other was negative, with an additional 22 (8.9%) differing on the extent of inflammation. Eighteen cases with severe inflammation, six with candida and two with EOE were detected only at endoscopy, while 18 with candida and significant inflammation, 13 with ulcer slough, one probable EOE and one viral oesophagitis were identified on the Cytosponge only. Conclusions: The Cytosponge detects a range of benign oesophageal pathologies, and therefore has potential clinical utility in the triaging of patients with troublesome reflux symptoms. This warrants further investigation.',\n",

We evaluated the value of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a representative English survey. Methods: We used data from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey pilot study.

Results: In total, there were 36,061 individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 test between 26 April and 27 June 2020. Of these, 625 (1.7%) reported symptoms on the day of the test. There were 115 (0.32%) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Of the 115, there were 27 (23.5%) who were symptomatic and 88 (76.5%) who were asymptomatic on the day of the test. Focusing on those with specific symptoms (cough, and/or fever, and/or loss of taste/smell), there were 158 (0.43%) with such symptoms on the day of the test. Of the 115 with a positive SARS-CoV-2, there were 16 (13.9%) reporting symptoms. In contrast, 99 (86.1%) did not report specific symptoms on the day of the test. The PPV for all symptoms was 4.3% and for the specific symptoms 10.1%. The specificity and NPV of symptoms were above 98%. Conclusion: COVID-19 symptoms are poor markers of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 76.5% of this random sample who tested positive reported no symptoms, and 86.1% reported none of those specific to COVID-19. A more widespread testing programme is necessary to capture \\x93silent\\x94 transmission and potentially prevent and reduce future outbreaks.',\n",
       "  '(0.458)  Background: Lozenges are solid dosage form which are intended to slowly dissolve in the mouth for therapeutic effect. Common cold and flu are common diseases which usually infects the respiratory tract including symptoms like head and body ache, fever, drowsiness, runny nose, congestion and cough. Aim: The present polyherbal lozenge formulations developed to eliminate all symptoms of cold and flu. Although many herbal and allopathic drugs are available, but they are not sufficient to treat all the symptoms through one formulation. Materials and Methods: Jaggery and sugar were dissolved in water and all the juices of drugs mixed and heated till suitable consistency and finally poured in lozenges mold and cooled to form lozenges. Results: The lozenges are evaluated for various quality parameters like hardness, friability, thickness, weight uniformity and disintegration time which comply with the standard mentioned in GMP guidelines. Conclusion: Lozenge is completely herbal containing no synthetic ingredient and is economical to treat all the symptoms of cold and flu.',\n",
       "  '(0.457)  Background UK veterans suffering from a psychological or psychiatric illness as a consequence of service in the Second World War were entitled to a war pension. Their case files, which include regular medical assessments, are a valuable resource to investigate the nature, distribution and duration of symptoms.Methods A standardised form was used to collect data from pension records of a random sample of 500 UK army veterans from the first presentation in the 1940s until 1980. Data were also gathered from 50 civilians and 54 emergency responders with a pension for post-traumatic illness following air-raids.Results The 10 most common symptoms reported by veterans were anxiety, depression, sleep problems, headache, irritability/anger, tremor/shaking, difficulty completing tasks, poor concentration, repeated fears and avoidance of social contact. Nine of the 10 were widely distributed across the veteran population when symptoms were ranked by the number of subjects who reported them. Nine symptoms persisted significantly longer in the veteran sample than in emergency responders. These included seven of the most common symptoms, together with two others: Muscle pain and restlessness. The persistence of these symptoms in the veteran group suggests a post-traumatic illness linked to lengthy overseas service in combat units.Conclusions The nature and duration of symptoms exhibited by veterans may be associated with their experience of heightened risks. Exposure to severe or prolonged trauma seems to be associated with chronic multi-symptom illness, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and somatic expressions of pain that may delay or complicate the recovery process.'],\n",
       " ['(0.814)  We aimed to assess the difference in the accuracy of readings from automated office blood pressure machines with each other or with manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese individuals. We collected awake 48-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, two automated office blood pressure device (BpTRU and WatchBP) readings, and manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese patients (n = 135) with hypertension in a randomized sequence. Differences were compared using paired t-tests and Bland\\x96Altman plots. The sensitivity and specificity of the techniques for detecting elevated blood pressure were calculated using awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as the reference standard. The WatchBP device\\x92s and awake ambulatory blood pressure readings were similar. The BpTRU device provided significantly lower mean systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressure readings, while manual office BP provided significantly higher mean systolic (P = 0.008) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressure readings than the awake automated office blood pressure readings. Automated and manual office blood pressure measurements showed similar sensitivity, specificity, and 95% limits of agreement as based on Bland\\x96Altman plots. The mean systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.02) blood pressure readings of WatchBP and BpTRU differed, and their diagnostic performances were not superior than those of manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese patients. Therefore, automated office blood pressure measurements cannot be routinely recommended for Chinese individuals in clinical practice. More studies are needed to confirm these results.',\n",
       "  '(0.725)  Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7\\x96128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0\\x96123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9\\x9679·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·9\\x9677·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% (21·4\\x9627·1) in men and 20·1% (17·8\\x9622·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

       "  '(0.714)  Background: Heavy metal contamination is widespread in Bangladesh. Previous studies have observed lead increases blood pressure over time. However, the role of other metal contaminants and essential micronutrients, which could also adversely affect blood pressure or act as protective factors, is understudied. Objectives: We therefore evaluated the associations of lead, manganese, and selenium with blood and pulse pressure trajectories. Methods: We prospectively followed placebo-assigned participants nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of arsenic-related skin cancer (n = 255). Blood lead, manganese, and selenium were measured at baseline; blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 3 biennial follow-up examinations. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate associations with average annual changes in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Results: In models simultaneously adjusted for baseline blood lead, manganese, and selenium concentrations in addition to other potential confounders, lead was linearly associated with increases in systolic blood pressure, but not with diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure. A non-linear association was observed for manganese, such that mid-range concentrations were associated with decreases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Baseline selenium concentrations in the highest quartile were also associated with longitudinal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while null associations were observed with pulse pressure. In exploratory analyses, the combination of mid-range manganese and high selenium concentrations completely offset lead-associated increases in blood and pulse pressure. Conclusions: The results indicate a direct, linear association of lead exposure with systolic blood pressure, and manganese and selenium exposures within certain ranges may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in this population. The findings of this study suggest toxic lead exposures remain a significant public health problem in Bangladesh where high levels are associated with high blood pressure; however, the nutritionally essential micronutrients manganese and selenium appear to confer protection from the hypertensive effects of lead.',\n",
       "  '(0.713)  Background: Change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure could be due to both shifts in the entire distribution of blood pressure (representing the combined effects of public health interventions and secular trends) and changes in its high-blood-pressure tail (representing successful clinical interventions to control blood pressure in the hypertensive population). Our aim was to quantify the contributions of these two phenomena to the worldwide trends in the prevalence of raised blood pressure. Methods: We pooled 1018 population-based studies with blood pressure measurements on 88.6 million participants from 1985 to 2016. We first calculated mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and prevalence of raised blood pressure by sex and 10-year age group from 20-29 years to 70-79 years in each study, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights, where relevant. We used a linear mixed effect model to quantify the association between (probittransformed) prevalence of raised blood pressure and age-group- and sex-specific mean blood pressure. We calculated the contributions of change in mean SBP and DBP, and of change in the prevalence-mean association, to the change in prevalence of raised blood pressure. Results: In 2005-16, at the same level of population mean SBP and DBP, men and women in South Asia and in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa would have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure, and men and women in the highincome Asia Pacific and high-income Western regions would have the lowest. In most region-sex-age groups where the prevalence of raised blood pressure declined, one half or more of the decline was due to the decline in mean blood pressure. Where prevalence of raised blood pressure has increased, the change was entirely driven by increasing mean blood pressure, offset partly by the change in the prevalence-mean association. Conclusions: Change in mean blood pressure is the main driver of the worldwide change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, but change in the high-blood-pressure tail of the distribution has also contributed to the change in prevalence, especially in older age groups.',\n",
       "  '(0.666)  We have assessed the association between excessive orthostatic changes in blood pressure and risk of incident heart failure (HF) in older, community-dwelling men. This was a prospective cohort study of 3505 men (mean age, 68.5 years), who did not have prevalent HF, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Excessive orthostatic change in blood pressure was defined continuously and categorically as orthostatic hypotension (sitting-to-standing decrease in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), systolic orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg, diastolic orthostatic hypertension as diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), and orthostatic normotension (neither orthostatic hypotension nor orthostatic hypertension). There was a U-shaped association between orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and the risk of incident HF; for diastolic blood pressure, only its fall predicted HF. After adjustment for possible confounders, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for incident HF was 1.65 (1.24-2.18) in men with orthostatic hypotension and 0.90 (0.65-1.24) and 1.88 (1.30-2.73) in men with diastolic and systolic orthostatic hypertension, respectively. Both components of orthostatic hypotension were associated with increased risk, although the systolic component was more predictive than the diastolic component. Both orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension are associated with risk of incident HF in older men. Our findings suggest that orthostatic hypertension is defined by a rise beyond threshold in systolic blood pressure only. Further prospective studies in diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings.'],\n",
       " ['(0.6)  The change in hypometabolism affects the regional links in the brain network. Here, to understand the underlying brain metabolic network deficits during the early stage and disease evolution of AD (Alzheimer disease), we applied correlation analysis to identify the metabolic connectivity patterns using 18F-FDG PET data for NC (normal control), sMCI (stable MCI), pMCI (progressive MCI) and AD, and explore the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity between anatomically-defined brain regions. Regions extracted from 90 anatomical structures were used to construct the matrix for measuring the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. The brain connectivity patterns from the metabolic network show a decreasing trend of inter- and intra-hemispheric connections for NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD. Connection of temporal to the frontal or occipital regions is a characteristic pattern for conversion of NC to MCI, and the density of links in the parietal-occipital network is a differential pattern between sMCI and pMCI. The reduction pattern of inter and intra-hemispheric brain connectivity in the metabolic network depends on the disease stages, and is with a decreasing trend with respect to disease severity. Both frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital connectivity patterns in the metabolic network using 18F-FDG PET are the key feature for differentiating disease groups in AD.',\n",
       "  '(0.555)  Naturalistic theories of disease appeal to concepts of biological function, and use the notion of dysfunction as the basis of their definitions. Debates in the philosophy of biology demonstrate how attributing functions in organisms and establishing the function-dysfunction distinction is by no means straightforward. This problematization of functional ascription has undermined naturalistic theories and led some authors to abandon the concept of dysfunction, favoring instead definitions based in normative criteria or phenomenological approaches. Although this work has enhanced our understanding of disease and illness, we need not necessarily abandon naturalistic concepts of function and dysfunction in the disease debate. This article attempts to move towards a new naturalistic theory of disease that overcomes the limitations of previous definitions and offers advantages in the clinical setting. Our approach involves a re-evaluation of concepts of biological function employed by naturalistic theories. Drawing on recent insights from the philosophy of biology, we develop a contextual and evaluative account of function that is better suited to clinical medicine and remains consistent with contemporary naturalism. We also show how an updated naturalistic view shares important affinities with normativist and phenomenological positions, suggesting a possibility for consilience in the disease debate.',\n",
       "  '(0.484)  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a pathological process characterized by atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in the epicardial arteries, whether obstructive or non-obstructive. This process can be modified by lifestyle adjustments, pharmacological therapies, and invasive interventions designed to achieve disease stabilization or regression. The disease can have long, stable periods but can also become unstable at any time, typically due to an acute atherothrombotic event caused by plaque rupture or erosion. However, the disease is chronic, most often progressive, and hence serious, even in clinically apparently silent periods. The dynamic nature of the CAD process results in various clinical presentations, which can be conveniently categorized as either acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). The Guidelines presented here refer to the management of patients with CCS. The natural history of CCS is illustrated in Figure 1.',\n",
       "  '(0.463)  Vascular comorbidities have a deleterious impact on multiple sclerosis clinical outcomes but it is unclear whether this is mediated by an excess of extracranial vascular disease (i.e. atherosclerosis) and/or of cerebral small vessel disease or worse multiple sclerosis pathology. To address these questions, a study using a unique post-mortem cohort wherein whole body autopsy reports and brain tissue were available for interrogation was established. Whole body autopsy reports were used to develop a global score of systemic vascular disease that included aorta and coronary artery atheroma, cardiac hypertensive disease, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. The score was applied to 85 multiple sclerosis cases (46 females, age range 39 to 84 years, median 62.0 years) and 68 control cases. Post-mortem brain material from a subset of the multiple sclerosis (n = 42; age range 39-84 years, median 61.5 years) and control (n = 39) cases was selected for detailed neuropathological study. For each case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from the frontal and occipital white matter, basal ganglia and pons was used to obtain a global cerebral small vessel disease score that captured the presence and/or severity of arteriolosclerosis, periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin leakage, microinfarcts, and microbleeds. The extent of multiple sclerosis-related pathology (focal demyelination and inflammation) was characterized in the multiple sclerosis cases. Regression models were used to investigate the influence of disease status on systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease scores and, in the multiple sclerosis group, the relationship between multiple sclerosis-related pathology and both vascular scores. We show that: (i) systemic cardiovascular burden, and specifically atherosclerosis, is lower and cerebral small vessel disease is higher in multiple sclerosis cases that die at younger ages compared with control subjects; (ii) the association between systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease is stronger in patients with multiple sclerosis compared with control subjects; and (iii) periarteriolar changes, including periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin deposition and inflammation, are key features of multiple sclerosis pathology outside the classic demyelinating lesion. Our data argue against a common primary trigger for atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis but suggest that an excess burden of cerebral small vessel disease in multiple sclerosis may explain the link between vascular comorbidity and accelerated irreversibility disability.',\n",
       "  '(0.433)  Several philosophers of medicine have attempted to answer the question \\x93what is disease?\\x94 In current clinical practice, an umbrella term \\x93chronic kidney disease\\x94 (CKD) encompasses a wide range of kidney health states from commonly prevalent subclinical, asymptomatic disease to rare end-stage renal disease requiring transplant or dialysis to support life. Differences in severity are currently expressed using a \\x93stage\\x94 system, whereby stage 1 is the least severe, and stage 5 the most. Early stage CKD in older patients is normal, of little concern, and does not require treatment. However, studies have shown that many patients find being informed of their CKD distressing, even in its early stages. Using existing analyses of disease in the philosophy literature, we argue that the most prevalent diagnoses of CKD are not, in fact, diseases. We conclude that, in many diagnosed cases of CKD, diagnosing a patient with a \\x93disease\\x94 is not only redundant, but unhelpful.'],\n",

       "  '(0.534)  Objective: We assessed long-term incidence and prevalence trends of dementia and parkinsonism across major ethnic and immigrant groups in Ontario. Methods: Linking administrative databases, we established two cohorts (dementia 2001-2014 and parkinsonism 2001-2015) of all residents aged 20 to 100 years with incident diagnosis of dementia (N = 387,937) or parkinsonism (N = 59,617). We calculated age-and sex-standardized incidence and prevalence of dementia and parkinsonism by immigrant status and ethnic groups (Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population). We assessed incidence and prevalence trends using Poisson regression and Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Results: Across selected ethnic groups, dementia incidence and prevalence were higher in long-term residents than recent or longer-term immigrants from 2001 to 2014. During this period, age-and sex-standardized incidence of dementia in Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population increased, respectively, among longer-term immigrants (by 41%, 58%, and 42%) and long-term residents (28%, 7%, and 4%), and to a lesser degree among recent immigrants. The small number of cases precluded us from assessing parkinsonism incidence trends. For Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population, respectively, prevalence of dementia and parkinsonism modestly increased over time among recent immigrants but significantly increased among longer-term immigrants (dementia: 134%, 217%, and 117%; parkinsonism: 55%, 54%, and 43%) and long-term residents (dementia: 97%, 132%, and 71%; parkinsonism: 18%, 30%, and 29%). Adjustment for pre-existing conditions did not appear to explain incidence trends, except for stroke and coronary artery disease as potential drivers of dementia incidence. Conclusion: Recent immigrants across major ethnic groups in Ontario had considerably lower rates of dementia and parkinsonism than long-term residents, but this difference diminished with longer-term immigrants.',\n",

The Dementia Grief Model explicates the unique process of pre-death grief in dementia caregivers.

       "  '(0.521)  Dementia, a term that describes a variety of brain conditions marked by gradual, persistent and progressive cognitive decline, affects a significant proportion of older adults. Older adults with dementia are sometimes perceived less favourably than those without dementia. Furthermore, compared to persons without dementia, those with dementia are often perceived by others as having reduced personhood. This study was aimed at investigating whether differences in attitudes towards dementia and personhood perceptions vary as a function of age group, care-giver status, attitudes towards ageing, dementia knowledge, gender and education. In total 196 younger, middle-aged and older adults were recruited. Findings revealed that being a care-giver as well as having less ageist attitudes were predictive of being more comfortable around persons with dementia, having more knowledge about dementia and ascribing greater personhood to people with dementia. Those with more dementia knowledge (prior to the study) were less comfortable around people with dementia. Finally, when controlling this prior dementia knowledge, older adults were more comfortable around people with dementia compared to younger and middle-aged adults. Gender and education were not associated with any of the variables under study. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of age-and care-giver-related factors in the determination of attitudes towards dementia.',\n",

Design: A qualitative study was conducted to describe and understand how Admiral Nurses are experienced and encountered by carers as part of their narrative around supporting a relative with dementia. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 carers between November 2017\\x96April 2018. They lasted between 45 and 90\\xa0min. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data. Findings: An overarching concept of \\x93the unity\\x96division paradox\\x94 was derived from the data. This highlights the complex interchange between the carer with (a) the person with dementia, (b) other individuals and (c) external services. Such interactions can make carers feel part of a larger network (unity) but also as if they are on their own, fighting on behalf of the person with dementia (division). This concept was underpinned by the following themes: (a) I becomes we; (b) My private world is encroached by dementia; (c) I\\x92m left navigating an unwieldy system; (d) Are you with or against us?; and (e) Recreating boundaries to rediscover me. Conclusion: The identity and unique characteristics and interests of those caring for a person with dementia may be lost as they encounter tensions associated with the unity\\x96division paradox. Admiral Nurses can help carers feel less alone in managing internal and external struggles by supporting them to do their best for a loved one with dementia.

Methods: At baseline, we measured toenail concentrations of 16 metals for 903 premenopausal women in the Sister Study (2003-2009). Age at menopause was ascertained through follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between individual metals and age at menopause. We used quantile-g-computation to examine the association between age at menopause and the joint effect of a simultaneous increase in (1) all metals and for subgroups of metals categorized as (2) essential or (3) non-essential. Results: For individual metals, we observed negligible associations except for an interquartile range increase in lead which was modestly associated with an earlier age at menopause (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05). In the mixture analyses, a quartile increase in all metals was associated with a later age at menopause (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.02). The metals with the largest negative contributions (i.e., associated with a later age at menopause) were chromium and nickel. The joint effect for the essential metals remained inverse (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.07), but was attenuated for nonessential metals (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76, 1.24). Conclusions: Although no individual metal was strongly associated with age at menopause, our joint effect analysis suggests that having low levels of essential metals could be associated with an earlier age at menopause.',\n",

Currently, no body fat percent (BF%) centile distance and velocity curves exist for Canadian youth. Objectives: To develop sex-specific and ethnic-specific BF% centile distance and velocity curves for White and Asian-Canadian youth. Methods: We utilized 4734 observations from 944 participants (female = 487; Asian = 532) to create sex-specific BF% velocity curves for age 10 to 18 years and sex-specific and ethnic-specific BF% percentile distance curves for ages 9 to 18 years for White and Asian children. BF% was derived from whole body DXA scans. Results: BF% centile distance curves for Asian and White girls were similar. BF% at most centiles plateaued around age 16 for Asian but not for White boys. Velocity curves for boys declined from age 11 to 13 years and then increased until age 18 years. For girls from 10 to 15 years, velocity curves converged towards the 50th centile then remained flat from 16 to 18 years. Conclusions: BF% distance and velocity centiles can be used to identify when an individual veers from an average BF% accrual trajectory.

Results: The mean age of younger and older participants was 26.0 ± 5.7 years, and 65.1 ± 6.6 years respectively. Peak O2 consumption was significantly lower in older compared to the younger age group (18.8 ± 5.2 vs 34.4 ± 9.8 mL/kg/min, p < 0.01). Peak exercise cardiac output and cardiac index were not significantly different between the younger and older age groups (22.7 ± 5.0 vs 22.1 ± 3.9 L/min, p = 0.59; and 12.4 ± 2.9 vs 11.8 ± 1.9 L/min/m2, p = 0.29). Despite demonstrating significantly lower peak heart rate by 33 beats/min (129 ± 18.3 vs 162 ± 19.9, p < 0.01), older participants demonstrated significantly higher stroke volume and stroke volume index compared to the younger age group (173 ± 41.5 vs 142 ± 34.9 mL/min, p < 0.01; and 92.1 ± 18.1 vs 78.3 ± 19.5 mL/m2, p < 0.01). Arteriovenous O2 difference was significantly lower in older compared to younger age group participants (9.01 ± 3.0 vs 15.8 ± 4.3 mlO2/100 mL blood, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Ability of skeletal muscles to extract delivered oxygen represented by reduced arteriovenous O2 difference at peak exercise appears to be the key determinant of exercise tolerance in healthy older individuals.',\n",
       "  '(0.477)  Skeletal maturity can be used as a biological indicator of the tempo of growth in children and adolescents. We present a description of skeletal maturity from a cohort of white Australian children and describe variation in skeletal maturity based on child age. Participants (n = 71; age 10.5\\x9613.9 years) were recruited from the \\x91Healthy, Active Preschool & Primary Years (HAPPY)\\x92 study. Left hand-wrist radiographs were used to determine skeletal maturity using the Tanner-Whitehouse III (TW3) RUS technique. In boys, the mean skeletal maturity offset (bone age\\x96chronological age) was -0.12 ± 0.19 years and 57.9% had delayed skeletal maturity compared to chronological age. Among those with delayed skeletal maturity, the average delay was 0.99 years (range 0.02\\x962.54 years). In girls, skeletal age was advanced, on average, compared to chronological age by 0.32 ± 0.20 years. Among the 39.4% of girls with delayed skeletal maturity, the average delay was 0.48 years (range: 0.01\\x962.28). Four children in the sample exhibited a delay in skeletal maturity greater than 2 years. In the context of secular trends towards advanced skeletal maturity observed globally, delayed skeletal maturation in this white, economically privileged cohort are surprising and warrant further exploration.'],\n",
       " ['(0.77)  Background: The physical environment can facilitate or hinder physical activity. A challenge in promoting physical activity is ensuring that the physical environment is supportive and that these supports are appropriately tailored to the individual or group in question. Ideally, aspects of the environment that impact physical activity would be enhanced, but environmental changes take time, and identifying ways to provide more precision to physical activity recommendations might be helpful for specific individuals or groups. Therefore, moving beyond a \\x93one size fits all\\x94 to a precision-based approach is critical. Main body: To this end, we considered 4 critical aspects of the physical environment that influence physical activity (walkability, green space, traffic-related air pollution, and heat) and how these aspects could enhance our ability to precisely guide physical activity. Strategies to increase physical activity could include optimizing design of the built environment or mitigating of some of the environmental impediments to activity through personalized or population-wide interventions. Conclusions: Although at present non-personalized approaches may be more widespread than those tailored to one person\\x92s physical environment, targeting intrinsic personal elements (e.g., medical conditions, sex, age, socioeconomic status) has interesting potential to enhance the likelihood and ability of individuals to participate in physical activity.',\n",
       "  '(0.677)  Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and characterize patterns of physical activity among office workers employed in largely sedentary occupations at a major health insurer located in the Southeastern USA. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used latent class analysis to identify segments of office workers (n=239) based on their self-reported activities of daily living and exercise behaviors. The authors examined the association of demographic characteristics with segment membership, and differences in accelerometer-measured weekly minutes of light and moderate-vigorous physical activity across segments. Findings - The authors identified two segments and labeled them \"exerciser\" and \"non-exerciser.\" Being female was associated with lower odds of membership in the \"exerciser\" segment (OR=0.18; 95% CI=0.06, 0.52), while those with at least a bachelor\\'s degree were more likely to be in the \"exerciser\" segment (OR=2.12; 95% CI=1.02, 4.40). Mean minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per week were greater for the \"exerciser\" segment than the \"non-exerciser\" segment. Practical implications - Based on this sample, the authors found that office workers in sedentary occupations were roughly equally divided and distinguished by their engagement in exercise-type behaviors. The findings underscore the need for innovative workplace programming that enhances activity opportunities particularly for those that are not likely to exercise. Originality/value - A scarcity of research on activity patterns among office workers inhibits development of targeted worksite activity programming. The present research reveals two segments of workers with regard to their activity patterns and suggests ways for worksites to meet their unique needs.',\n",
       "  '(0.668)  Background N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity Troponin T (hsTnT) are markers of cardiac injury used in diagnosis of heart failure and myocardial infarction respectively, and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Since physical activity is protective against cardiovascular disease and heart failure, we investigated whether higher levels of physical activity, and less sedentary behaviour were associated with lower NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Methods and results Cross sectional study of 1130 men, age 70\\x9691 years, from the British Regional Heart Study, measured in 2010\\x962012. Fasting blood samples were analysed for NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Relationships between activity and NT-proBNP or hsTnT were non-linear; biomarker levels were lower with higher total activity, steps, moderate/vigorous activity and light activity only at low to moderate levels of activity. For example, for each additional 10 min of moderate/vigorous activity, NT-proBNP was lower by 35.7% (95% CI - 47.9, - 23.6) and hsTnT by 8.4% (95% CI -11.1, - 5.6), in men who undertook < 25 or 50 min of moderate/vigorous activity per day respectively. Biomarker levels increased linearly with increasing sedentary behaviour, but not independently of moderate/vigorous activity. Conclusion Associations between biomarkers and moderate/vigorous activity (and between hsTnT and light activity) were independent of sedentary behaviour, suggesting activity is driving the relationships. In these older men with concomitantly low levels of physical activity, activity may be more important in protecting against cardiac health deterioration in less active individuals, although reverse causality might be operating.',\n",
       "  '(0.661)  Affective barriers like negative affect (time-varying subjective state) or fear of falling (person-trait) may reduce daily physical activity among older adults. A group of 123 community-dwelling older adults (Ma = ENGL = 71.83, range = 64 85, 63% women) from Canada participated in a 10-day time-sampling study. We used accelerometer-assessed physical activity, assessing negative affect three times per day and fear of falling once prior to the 10-day period. Using multilevel models, we noted considerable variability in physical activity between days (activity counts: 47%; steps: 55%). We found time-varying negative associations between daily physical activity and daily negative affect. Fear of falling was not related to daily physical activity. Findings point to the merit of examining time-varying differences in subjective experiences when looking for physical activity barriers in older age.',\n",
       "  '(0.652)  Objectives: Physical activity is a key health behavior that reduces disease risk, and yet most older adults are not very active. This study examined time-varying associations between physical activity and a recognized barrier, namely, precipitation. And it examined the moderating role of physical activity intentions and functional mobility on precipitation\\x96physical activity associations. Method: One hundred and twenty-six older adults (M age = 72 years; 64% women) from Metro Vancouver provided health and background information and wore triaxial accelerometers for up to 10 consecutive days. Daily weather information was collected from local weather stations. Results: Multilevel models corroborate previous research by showing that older adults engaged in less physical activity on days with increased precipitation across four indices: activity counts, step counts, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and bout-corrected minutes of MVPA. Older adults with strong physical activity intentions engaged in more physical activity overall. Physical activity intentions also modified the association between time-varying precipitation and activity counts and step counts, whereas functional mobility moderated the negative association between precipitation and activity counts and minutes of MVPA. Discussion: Findings highlight the important role of time-varying influences on physical activity and how these associations are moderated by psychological and biological factors.'],\n",

This work evaluates changes in nutrient intake and diet quality over 12 months (n = 205). Individualized diet counselling was provided by 14 RDs at 3 centres. Two 24-h recalls, the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C), and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were completed at each time point. Total energy intake decreased by 145 ± 586 kcal (mean ± SD) over 3 months with an additional 76 ± 452 kcal decrease over 3\\x9612 months. HEI-C improved from 58 ± 15 to 69 ± 12 at 3 months and was maintained at 12 months. Similarly, MDS (n = 144) improved from 4.8 ± 1.2 to 6.2 ± 1.9 at 3 months and was maintained at 12 months.

       "  '(0.424)  Background: To evaluate computed tomography (CT) patterns of post-SBRT lung injury in lung cancer and identify time points of serial CT changes. Materials and methods: One hundred eighty-three tumors in 170 patients were evaluated on sequential CTs within 29 months (median). Frequencies of post-SBRT CT patterns and time points of initiation and duration were assessed. Duration of increase of primary lesion or surrounding injury without evidence of local recurrence and time to stabilization or local recurrence were evaluated. Results: Post-SBRT CT patterns could overlap in the same patient and were nodule-like pattern (69%), consolidation with ground glass opacity (GGO) (41%), modified conventional pattern (39%), peribronchial/patchy consolidation (42%), patchy GGO (24%), diffuse consolidation (16%), \\x93orbit sign\\x94 (21%), mass-like pattern (19%), scar-like pattern (15%) and diffuse GGO (3%). Patchy GGO started at 4 months post-SBRT. Peribronchial/patchy consolidation and consolidation with GGO started at 4 and 5 months respectively. Diffuse consolidation, diffuse GGO and orbit sign started at 5, 6 and 8 months respectively. Mass-like, modified conventional and scar-like pattern started at 8, 12 and 12 months respectively. Primary lesion (n = 11) or surrounding injury (n = 85) increased up to 13 months. Primary lesion (n = 119) or surrounding injury (n = 115) started to decrease at 4 and 9 months respectively. Time to stabilization was 20 months. The most common CT pattern at stabilization was modified conventional pattern (49%), scar-like pattern (23%) and mass-like pattern (12%). Local recurrence (n = 15) occurred at a median time of 18 months. Conclusion: Different CT patterns of lung injury post-SBRT appear in predictable time points and have variable but predictable duration. Familiarity with these patterns and timeframes of appearance helps differentiate them from local recurrence.',\n",

Revised IRs were fabricated with 1\\x964 OxyChips with a thin wire encapsulated with two biocompatible coatings. Biocompatibility and chemical characterization tests were performed. Rabbits were implanted with either an IR with 2 oxygen sensors or a biocompatible-control sample in both the brain and hind leg.

       "  '(0.373)  High protein intake in young children is associated with excess gains in weight and body fat, but the specific role of different protein sources has yet to be described. The study aimed to investigate the role of different types of protein in the post-weaning stage on weight, BMI and overweight/obesity at 60 months. Intakes of animal, dairy and plant protein and a dietary pattern characterising variation in protein types at 21 months of age were estimated using a 3-d diet diary in a cohort of 2154 twins; weight and height were recorded every 3 months from birth to 60 months. Longitudinal mixed-effect models investigated the associations between sources of protein intake or dietary pattern scores and BMI, weight and overweight/obesity from 21 months up to 60 months. Adjusting for confounders, dairy protein intake at 21 months was positively associated with greater weight (46 (95 % CI 21, 71) g and BMI up to 60 months (0·04 (95 % CI 0·004, 0·070) kg/m2) and the odds of overweight/obesity at 3 years (OR 1·12; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·24). Milk showed associations of similar magnitude. A dietary pattern low in dairy protein and high in plant protein was associated with lower weight gain up to 60 months, but not overweight/obesity. Intake of dairy products in early childhood is most strongly associated with weight gain, compared with other protein sources. A dietary pattern characterised by lower protein intake and greater protein source diversity at 2 years may confer a lower risk of excess weight gain.',\n",
       "  '(0.361)  Objective: This study assessed whether immediate postpartum insertion of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants is associated with a difference in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 and 6 months postpartum compared to delayed insertion at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. Study design: We conducted a randomized trial of women in Uganda who desired contraceptive implants postpartum. We randomly assigned participants to receive either immediate (within 5 days of delivery) or delayed (6 to 8 weeks postpartum) insertion of a two-rod levonorgestrel contraceptive implant system. This is a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating breastfeeding outcomes. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was change in infant weight; infants were weighed and measured at birth and 6 months. We used a validated questionnaire to assess onset of lactogenesis daily in person while participants were in the hospital, and then daily by phone after they left the hospital, until lactogenesis was documented. We used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess breastfeeding continuation and concerns at 3 months and 6 months postpartum. Results: Among the 96 women randomized to the immediate group and the 87 women to the delayed group, the mean change in infant weight from birth to 6 months was similar between groups: 4632 g in the immediate group and 4407 g in the delayed group (p=.26). Among the 97 women who had not experienced lactogenesis prior to randomization, the median time to onset of lactogenesis did not differ significantly between the immediate and delayed groups (65 h versus 63 h; p=.84). Similar proportions of women in the immediate and delayed groups reported exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (74% versus 71%; p=.74) and 6 months (48% versus 52%; p=.58). Conclusion: We found no association between the timing of postpartum initiation of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants and change in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 or 6 months postpartum. Implications: This study provides evidence that immediate postpartum initiation of contraception implants does not have a deleterious effect on infant growth or initiation or continuation of breastfeeding.'],\n",

It focuses on the perspective of residential care providers on implementing direct payments, which aimed to improve the level of choice and control over care available to their residents. The article explores the views of providers, using interviews and survey responses of care home managers and owners.

       "  \"(0.556)  This paper examines how care home managers in England conceptualised the approach to delivering personalised care in the homes they managed. We conducted interviews with care home managers and mapped the approaches they described on two distinct characterisations of personalised care prominent in the research and practitioner literature: the importance of close care relationships and the degree of resident choice and decision-making promoted by the care home. We derived three 'types' of personalised care in care homes. These conceptualise the care home as an 'institution', a 'family' and a 'hotel'. We have added a fourth type, the 'co-operative', to propose a type that merges proximate care relationships with an emphasis on resident choice and decision-making. We conclude that each approach involves trade-offs and that the 'family' model may be more suitable for people with advanced dementia, given its emphasis on relationships. While the presence of a range of diverse approaches to personalising care in a care home market may be desirable as a matter of choice, access to care homes in England is likely to be constrained by availability and cost.\",\n",

As part of its agenda to modernize social care, the Government tested their use in long-term residential care in 18 trailblazing councils in England. This article presents findings from the independent evaluation of this initiative, using interviews with project leads seconded to the programme in all participating councils, and with council and care home staff involved in implementing direct payments in residential care in five sites. Interviews were conducted between September 2014 and November 2015. They explored professionals' views and experiences of personalization in residential care and their thoughts on the potential contribution of direct payments to promoting personalization. Whilst there was agreement that good care takes personal preferences into account and that many care homes could provide a more personalized service, doubts were voiced about whether direct payments were an appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim. This was seen as particularly pertinent in relation to residents with very high care needs and limited capacity to exercise choice and control. Interviewees also identified a number of risks and challenges to implementation, including financial risks to care homes. The findings from these interviews suggest that the contribution of direct payments to personalizing residential care may be more modest than expected.\",\n",

Aim: Provide a population perspective on end-of-life palliative care delivery across health sectors. Design: Retrospective population-level cohort study, describing palliative care in the last year of life using linked health administrative databases. Setting/participants: All decedents in Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012 (n = 177,817). Results: Across all health sectors, about half (51.9%) of all decedents received at least one record of palliative care in the last year of life. Being female, middle-aged, living in wealthier and urban neighborhoods, having cancer, and less multi-morbidity were all associated with higher odds of palliative care receipt. Among 92,276 decedents receiving palliative care, 84.9% received care in acute care hospitals. Among recipients, 35 mean days of palliative care were delivered. About half (49.1%) of all palliative care days were delivered in the last 2 months of life, and half (50.1%) had palliative care initiated in this period. Only about one-fifth of all decedents (19.3%) received end-of-life care through publicly funded home care. Less than 10% of decedents had a record of a palliative care home visit from a physician. Conclusion: We describe methods to capture palliative care using administrative data. Despite an estimate of overall reach (51.9%) that is higher than previous estimates, we have shown that palliative care is infrequently delivered particularly in community settings and to non-cancer patients and occurs close to death.',\n",

Overall, the transformation into coordinated care organizations was associated with a 7 percent relative reduction in expenditures across the sum of these services, attributable primarily to reductions in inpatient utilization. The change to coordinated care organizations also demonstrated reductions in avoidable emergency department visits and improvements in some measures of appropriateness of care, but also exhibited reductions in primary care visits, a potential area of concern.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 369 071 chest radiographs and associated radiology reports from 64 581 patients (mean age, 51.71 years; 54.51% women) from the MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph dataset were included. This dataset was split into patients with and without congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary edema severity labels from the associated radiology reports were extracted from patients with CHF as four different ordinal levels: 0, no edema; 1, vascular congestion; 2, interstitial edema; and 3, alveolar edema. Deep learning models were developed using two approaches: a semisupervised model using a variational autoencoder and a pretrained supervised learning model using a dense neural network. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on both models. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for differentiating alveolar edema from no edema was 0.99 for the semisupervised model and 0.87 for the pretrained models. Performance of the algorithm was inversely related to the difficulty in categorizing milder states of pulmonary edema (shown as AUCs for semisupervised model and pretrained model, respectively): 2 versus 0, 0.88 and 0.81; 1 versus 0, 0.79 and 0.66; 3 versus 1, 0.93 and 0.82; 2 versus 1, 0.69 and 0.73; and 3 versus 2, 0.88 and 0.63.

       "  '(0.562)  In light of the low signal-to-noise nature of many large biological data sets, we propose a novel method to learn the structure of association networks using Gaussian graphical models combined with prior knowledge. Our strategy includes two parts. In the first part, we propose a model selection criterion called structural Bayesian information criterion, in which the prior structure is modeled and incorporated into Bayesian information criterion. It is shown that the popular extended Bayesian information criterion is a special case of structural Bayesian information criterion. In the second part, we propose a two-step algorithm to construct the candidate model pool. The algorithm is data-driven and the prior structure is embedded into the candidate model automatically. Theoretical investigation shows that under some mild conditions structural Bayesian information criterion is a consistent model selection criterion for high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model. Simulation studies validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing ones and show the robustness to the model misspecification. Application to relative concentration data from infant feces collected from subjects enrolled in a large molecular epidemiological cohort study validates that metabolic pathway involvement is a statistically significant factor for the conditional dependence between metabolites. Furthermore, new relationships among metabolites are discovered which can not be identified by the conventional methods of pathway analysis. Some of them have been widely recognized in biological literature.',\n",

This paper introduces the R package lcsm, a tool that aims to help users understand, analyse, and visualise different latent change score models. The lcsm package provides functions to generate model syntax for basic univariate and bivariate latent change score models with different model specifications. It is also possible to visualise different model specifications in simplified path diagrams. An interactive application illustrates the main functions of the package and demonstrates how the model syntax and path diagrams change based on different model specifications. This R package aims to increase the transparency of reporting analyses and to provide an additional resource to learn latent change score modelling.',\n",
       "  '(0.52)  Composite endpoints are commonplace in biomedical research. The complex nature of many health conditions and medical interventions demand that composite endpoints be employed. Different approaches exist for the analysis of composite endpoints. A Monte Carlo simulation study was employed to assess the statistical properties of various regression methods for analyzing binary composite endpoints. We also applied these methods to data from the BETTER trial which employed a binary composite endpoint. We demonstrated that type 1 error rates are poor for the Negative Binomial regression model and the logistic generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Bias was minimal and power was highest in the binomial logistic regression model, the linear regression model, the Poisson (corrected for over-dispersion) regression model and the common effect logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Convergence was poor in the distinct effect GEE models, the logistic GLMM and some of the zero-one inflated beta regression models. Considering the BETTER trial data, the distinct effect GEE model struggled with convergence and the collapsed composite method estimated an effect, which was greatly attenuated compared to other models. All remaining models suggested an intervention effect of similar magnitude. In our simulation study, the binomial logistic regression model (corrected for possible over/under-dispersion), the linear regression model, the Poisson regression model (corrected for over-dispersion) and the common effect logistic GEE model appeared to be unbiased, with good type 1 error rates, power and convergence properties.',\n",
       "  '(0.497)  The accelerated failure time (AFT) model has been suggested as an alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model. However, a parametric AFT model requires the specification of an appropriate distribution for the event time, which is often difficult to identify in real-life studies and may limit applications. A semiparametric AFT model was developed by Komárek et al based on smoothed error distribution that does not require such specification. In this article, we develop a spline-based AFT model that also does not require specification of the parametric family of event time distribution. The baseline hazard function is modeled by regression B-splines, allowing for the estimation of a variety of smooth and flexible shapes. In comprehensive simulations, we validate the performance of our approach and compare with the results from parametric AFT models and the approach of Komárek. Both the proposed spline-based AFT model and the approach of Komárek provided unbiased estimates of covariate effects and survival curves for a variety of scenarios in which the event time followed different distributions, including both simple and complex cases. Spline-based estimates of the baseline hazard showed also a satisfactory numerical stability. As expected, the baseline hazard and survival probabilities estimated by the misspecified parametric AFT models deviated from the truth. We illustrated the application of the proposed model in a study of colon cancer.'],\n",

Design: Qualitative grounded theory study. Setting: Organizations who had participated in Accreditation Canada's Qmentum program during January 2014-June 2016. Participants: Individuals who had coordinated the accreditation process or were involved in managing or promoting quality. Results: The accreditation process is largely viewed as a quality assurance process, which often feeds in to quality improvement activities if the feedback aligns with organizational priorities. Three key stages are required for accreditation to impact quality: coherence, organizational buy-in and organizational action. These stages map to constructs outlined in Normalization Process Theory. Coherence is established when an organization and its staff perceive that accreditation aligns with the organization's beliefs, context and model of service delivery. Organizational buy-in is established when there is both a conceptual champion and an operational champion, and is influenced by both internal and external contextual factors. Quality improvement action occurs when organizations take purposeful action in response to observations, feedback or self-reflection resulting from the accreditation process. Conclusions: The accreditation process has the potential to influence quality through a series of three mechanisms: coherence, organizational buy-in and collective quality improvement action. Internal and external contextual factors, including individual characteristics, influence an organization's experience of accreditation.\",\n",

Methods We analyzed CPR quality data from treated adult OHCA occurring over a 40 month period beginning January 1, 2013 from the Rescu Epistry-cardiac arrest database. High quality CPR was defined as chest compression fraction (CCF) >0.7, compression rate >100/min and compression depth >5.0\\xa0cm. Our primary objective was to compare the proportion of resuscitations for which all CPR quality benchmarks were met between scene and transport phases of resuscitation. Our secondary objectives were to compare the quality of CPR between the scene phase and transport phase of resuscitation. Results The proportion of patients with high quality CPR was similar on scene compared to during transport (45.8% vs. 42.5%; <U+2206> 3.3 %; 95% CI: -1.4, 8.1). Regarding individual CPR metrics, median compression rate was higher on scene compared to transport (105.8 compressions per minute (cpm) vs. 102.0\\xa0cpm; <U+2206> 3.8\\xa0cpm; 95% CI: 2.5, 4.0), while median compression depth (5.56\\xa0cm vs. 5.33\\xa0cm; <U+2206> 0.23\\xa0cm; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.26) and median CCF (0.95 vs. 0.87; <U+2206> 0.08; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.08) were higher during the transport phase. Conclusions High quality CPR metrics were similar in both (scene and transport) locations of resuscitation. These results suggest that high quality, manual compressions can be performed by prehospital providers regardless of location.',\n",
       "  \"(0.502)  Background: To combat the high cost and increasing burden of quality reporting, the Medicare Payment Advisory (MedPAC) has recommended using claims data wherever possible to measure clinical quality. In this article, we use a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and existing quality metrics to explore the impact of changes in quality metric methodology on measured quality performance, the association with patient outcomes, and hospital rankings. Methods and Results: We used 100% Medicare Parts A and B and a random 40% sample of Part D from 2008 to 2015 to create (1) a cohort of 295 494 fee-for-service beneficiaries with =1 hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and (2) a cohort of 1079 hospitals with =11 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction admissions in 2014 and 2015. We used Part D data to calculate ß-blocker use after discharge and ß-blocker use over time. We then varied the quality metric methodologies to explore the impact on measured performance. We then used multivariable time-to-event analyses to explore the impact of metric methodology on the association between quality performance and patient outcomes and Kendall's Tau to describe impact of quality metric methodology on hospital rankings. We found that quality metric methodology had a significant impact on measured quality performance. The association between quality performance and readmissions was sensitive to changes in methodology but the association with 1-year mortality was not. Changes in quality metric methodology also had a substantial impact on hospital quality rankings. Conclusions: This article highlights how small changes in quality metric methodology can have a significant impact on measured quality performance, the association between quality performance and utilization-based outcomes, and hospital rankings. These findings highlight the need for standardized quality metric methodologies, better case-mix adjustment and cast further doubt on the use of utilization-based outcomes as quality metrics in chronic diseases.\",\n",
       "  '(0.499)  As population-based payment models become increasingly common, it is crucial to understand how such payment models affect health disparities. We evaluated health care quality and spending among enrollees in areas with lower versus higher socioeconomic status in Massachusetts before and after providers entered into the Alternative Quality Contract, a two-sided population-based payment model with substantial incentives tied to quality. We compared changes in process measures, outcome measures, and spending between enrollees in areas with lower and higher socioeconomic status from 2006 to 2012 (outcome measures were measured after the intervention only). Quality improved for all enrollees in the Alternative Quality Contract after their provider organizations entered the contract. Process measures improved 1.2 percentage points per year more among enrollees in areas with lower socioeconomic status than among those in areas with higher socioeconomic status. Outcome measure improvement was no different between the subgroups; neither were changes in spending. Larger or comparable improvements in quality among enrollees in areas with lower socioeconomic status suggest a potential narrowing of disparities. Strong pay-for-performance incentives within a population-based payment model could encourage providers to focus on improving quality for more disadvantaged populations.'],\n",
       " ['(0.603)  Purpose: To use recorded weight values to internally validate weight status and weight change coding in the primary care Electronic Health Record (EHR). Patients and methods: We included adult patients with weight-related Read codes recorded in the UK\\x92s Clinical Practice Research Datalink EHR between 2000 and 2017. Weight status codes were compared to weight values recorded on the same day and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for commonly used codes. Weight change codes were validated using three methods: the percentage (%) difference in kilograms at the time of the code and 1) the previous weight measurement, 2) the weight predicted using linear regression, and 3) the historic mean weight. Weight change codes were validated if estimates were consistent across two out of three methods. Results: A total of 8,108,481 weight codes were recorded in 1,000,002 patients\\x92 EHR. Twice as many were recorded in females (n=5,208,593, 64%). The mean body mass index for \\x93over-weight\\x94 codes ranged from 31.9 kg/m 2 to 46.9 kg/m 2 and from 17.4 kg/m 2 to 19.2 kg/m 2 for \\x93underweight\\x94 codes. PPVs for the most commonly used weight status codes ranged from 81.3% (80%\\x9682.5%) to 99.3% (99.2%\\x9699.4%). Across the estimation methods, and using only validated weight change codes, mean weight loss ranged from \\x96 5.2% (SD 5.8%) to \\x967.9% (SD 7.3%) and mean weight gain from 4.2 % (SD 5.5%) to 7.9 % (SD 8.2%). The previous and predicted weight methods were most consistent. Conclusion: We have developed an internationally applicable methodology to internally validate weight-related EHR coding by using available weight measurement data. We demonstrate the UK Read codes that can be confidently used to classify weight status and weight change in the absence of weight values. We provide the first evidence from primary care that a Read code for unexpected weight loss represents a mean loss of = 5 % in a 6-month period, which was broadly consistent across age groups and gender.',\n",
       "  '(0.598)  Little guidance is available to clinicians on how to talk about weight with their patients. The aim of this study is to explore youth preferences for weight-related conversations. Participants came from the National MyVoice Text Message Cohort. Between 7/2017 and 01/2018, 952 MyVoice participants provided open-ended responses via text message to three questions about weight-related conversations (\\x93Has your doctor ever talked to you about weight?\\x94, \\x93What did he or she say?\\x94, and \\x93What should a doctor NOT say when talking about weight?\\x94). The presence of themes was coded using standard qualitative methods. Of the 952 respondents, 568 (60%) reported that their doctor had talked with them about weight. Of these, 85% indicated that their doctor had notified them of their weight, BMI, or weight status and/or the need to change their body weight and 16% had doctors who provided advice about weight control. Eight themes emerged from the analysis of responses to the question \\x93What should a doctor NOT say when talking about weight?\\x94. The two most common themes were: (1): Avoid stigmatizing terms/language (32%); and (2) Do not shame patient for their weight (25%). Findings suggest that weight-related conversations do not reflect the preferences of the youth they are designed to benefit. Youth recommended that clinicians focus on health and sustainable behavioral solutions, avoid stigmatizing language and comparing them to others, and be aware of the potential harm associated with making assumptions that conflate weight with health behaviors, morality, or appearance.',\n",
       "  \"(0.582)  Background Finding effective referral policies for weight management services would have important public health implications. Aim Here we compare percentage weight change by referral methods, BMI categories and participants who have had attended weight loss programmes multiple times. Design and settings A prospective cohort study of 15,621 participants referred to 12-week behavioural weight loss programmes funded by the public health service in Birmingham, UK. Methods Comparisons were made between GP versus self-referrals, BMI =40 kg/m2\\x96<40 kg/m2 and multiple referrals compared to only one referral. Linear mixed modelling was used to assess percentage weight change after adjusting for covariates. Results Participant's mean age was 48.5 years, 78.7% were of white ethnicity, 90.3% female and mean baseline BMI was 36.3 kg/m2. There were no significant differences in percentage weight loss, between participants that self-referred and those that were referred by their general practitioner (GP) and no significant differences between baseline BMI categories. Referral to a weight loss programme more than once was associated with less weight loss at subsequent attendances (0.92%, 95% CI 0.70\\x961.14, p < 0.001). Conclusion Allowing self-referral to a weight loss programme widens access without compromising amount of weight lost. These programmes are beneficial for all categories of obesity, including those with a BMI =40 kg/m2. Attending weight management programmes more than once results in less weight loss and that swapping to a different program may be advisable.\",\n",
       "  '(0.532)  Background: Rapid weight gain is common with antipsychotic medication. Lost confidence, low mood and medication non-adherence often follow. Yet, the dynamic interactions between the physical and psychological consequences of weight gain, and implications for intervention, are unknown. Objectives: We examined first-person accounts of weight gain to identify preferences for weight change interventions. Design: A qualitative design was used to explore patients\\x92 experiences of weight change in the context of psychosis. Method: Semi-structured interviews, analysed using grounded theory, were conducted with 10 patients with psychosis. Sample validation was conducted with peer researchers with lived experience of psychosis. Results: Patients described that initially the extent and speed of weight gain was overshadowed by psychotic experiences and their treatment. This led to a shocking realisation of weight gain. The psychological impact of weight gain, most strikingly on the self-concept, was profound. Loss of self-worth and changed appearance amplified a sense of vulnerability. There were further consequences on mood, activity and psychotic experiences, such as voices commenting on appearance, that were additional obstacles in the challenging process of weight loss. Sedative effects of medication also contributed. Unsuccessful weight loss left little hope and few preferences for interventions. Early information about common weight gain trajectories and working with experts-by-experience were valued. Rebuilding self-confidence, efficacy and worth may be a necessary first step. Conclusions: The journey of weight gain in patients with psychosis is characterised by loss of self-worth, agency and hope. There are multiple stages in the journey, each with different psychological reactions, that may need different treatment responses.',\n",
       "  '(0.53)  Background Though many overweight and obese adults attempt to lose weight without formal support, little is known about the strategies used in self-directed weight loss attempts. We set out to assess cognitive and behavioural strategies for weight loss and their associations with weight change. Methods Prospective, web-based cohort study of overweight UK adults (BMI=25kg/m2) trying to lose weight through behaviour change. Strategy use was assessed using the OxFAB questionnaire and evaluated (1) at the domain level, (2) through exploratory factor analysis, and (3) in a model of strategies deemed a priori to be \"essential\" to weight management. Associations with weight change at 3 months were tested using linear regression. Results 486 participants answered all questions; 194 reported weight at baseline and at 3 months (mean weight change -3.3kg (SD 4.1)). Greater weight loss was significantly associated with the motivational support domain (-2.4kg, 95% CI -4.4 to -0.4), dietary impulse control (from factor analysis) (-0.6kg, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.03), and weight loss planning and monitoring (from factor analysis) (-1.3kg, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5). Higher scores in the model of essential behavioural strategies were significantly associated with greater weight loss (compared to participants using 6 or fewer of the 9 strategies, using 7 or more of the 9 strategies was associated with a 2.13kg greater weight loss (SE 0.58, p<0.001)). Conclusions Despite heterogeneity in the strategies employed for weight loss, coherent patterns of behaviours emerged for individual participants, some of which were associated with greater weight loss, including strategies relating to dietary impulse control, weight loss planning and monitoring, motivational support, information seeking and self-monitoring. Trials could test the effect of promoting use of these patterns on weight loss.'],\n",
       " ['(0.667)  Pain is a common problem among elite athletes and is frequently associated with sport injury. Both pain and injury interfere with the performance of elite athletes. There are currently no evidence-based or consensus-based guidelines for the management of pain in elite athletes.

More appropriately, a treatment strategy should address all contributors to pain including underlying pathophysiology, biomechanical abnormalities and psychosocial issues, and should employ therapies providing optimal benefit and minimal harm.

       "  '(0.619)  Background. Validity of pain recall is questioned in research. Objective. To evaluate the reliability of pain intensity recall for seniors in an emergency department (ED). Methods. This study was part of a prospective multicenter project for seniors (=65 years old) treated in an ED for minor traumatic injury. Pain intensity (0-10 numerical rating scale) was evaluated at the initial ED visit, at one week (baseline), and 3 months. At three months, patients were asked to recall the pain intensity they had at baseline. Results. 482 patients were interviewed (mean age 76.6 years, SD ± 7.3) and 72.8% were female. Intraclass correlation coefficient between pain at baseline and its recall was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.33). Senior patients tended to overestimate their pain intensity by a mean of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9-1.5) units. A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the variance of baseline pain recall at 3 months was explained by pain at ED visit (11%), pain at 3 months (7%), and pain at baseline (2%). Conclusion. The accuracy of pain intensity recall after three months is poor in seniors and seems to be influenced by the pain experienced at the time of injury.',\n",
       "  '(0.613)  Background: The use of quantitative sensory testing (QST) in multicenter studies has been quite limited, due in part to lack of standardized procedures among centers. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the application of the capsaicin pain model as a surrogate experimental human model of neuropathic pain in different centers and verify the variation in reports of QST measures across centers. Methods: A multicenter study conducted by the Quebec Pain Research Network in six laboratories allowed the evaluation of nine QST parameters in 60 healthy subjects treated with topical capsaicin to model unilateral pain and allodynia. The same measurements (without capsaicin) were taken in 20 patients with chronic neuropathic pain recruited from an independent pain clinic. Results: Results revealed that six parameters detected a significant difference between the capsaicin-treated and the control skin areas: (1) cold detection threshold (CDT) and (2) cold pain threshold (CPT) are lower on the capsaicin-treated side, indicating a decreased in cold sensitivity; (3) heat pain threshold (HPT) was lower on the capsaicin-treated side in healthy subjects, suggesting an increased heat pain sensitivity; (4) dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA); (5) mechanical pain after two stimulations (MPS2); and (6) mechanical pain summation after ten stimulations (MPS10), are increased on the capsaicin-treated side, suggesting an increased in mechanical pain (P\\xa0<\\xa00.002). CDT, CPT and HPT showed comparable effects across all six centers, with CPT and HPT demonstrating the best sensitivity. Data from the patients showed significant difference between affected and unaffected body side but only with CDT. Conclusion: These results provide further support for the application of QST in multicenter studies examining normal and pathological pain responses.',\n",
       "  '(0.6)  Background: The prescription of opioids for acute pain may be a driving factor in chronic opioid abuse. We examined patients\\x92 characteristics associated with the expectation of the receipt of opioid prescriptions for acute pain control. Methods: A 1-time survey was administered to adult patients at family medicine clinics in the Pacific Northwest between November 2018 and January 2019. Logistic regression modeled adjusted odds of expecting an opioid prescription in = 3 of the 4 dispositional acute pain scenarios by patient demographics, opioid use, past-week pain intensity and duration, past-week anxiety, and pain catastrophizing. Results: The survey was completed by 108 patients (62% female, 48% between 30 and 49 years of age, 75% non-Hispanic Whites). Most patients (71%) expected an opioid prescription in = 1 of the 4 scenarios; 26% expected a prescription in = 3 scenarios. Patients with higher levels of pain catastrophizing had more than 3 times greater odds of expecting opioids than those with lower pain catastrophizing (OR, 3.73; P = .032; 95% CI, 1.12-12.46); no other characteristics were statistically significant. Conclusion: Higher pain catastrophizing was associated with increased odds of expecting opioids in dispositional acute pain scenarios in outpatient settings. Future studies can determine whether addressing pain catastrophizing reduces expectations of opioid prescribing for acute pain control. The finding that most patients expected opioid prescriptions in acute pain scenarios needs further exploration into other potential factors associated with these expectations. Evidence-based guidelines for condition-specific acute pain management are warranted for appropriate opioid prescribing and to guide treatment expectations.',\n",

Method: We used an 11-point numeric pain rating scale to assess pain during movement in the preceding week and lateral spinal radiographs to confirm number, location, and severity of vertebral fractures. In model 1, we assessed the association between pain during movement and the number, severity, and location of fractures. We adjusted model 2 for pain medication use and age. Results: The mean age of participants was 76.4 (SD 6.9) years. We found no statistically significant associations between pain and fracture number (estimated ß = 0.23, 95% CI: \\x960.27, 0.68), fracture severity (estimated ß = \\x960.46, 95% CI: \\x961.38, 0.49), or fracture location at T4\\x96T8 (estimated ß = 0.06, 95% CI: \\x961.26, 1.34), T9\\x96L1 (estimated ß = 0.35, 95% CI: \\x961.17, 1.74), or L2\\x96L4 (estimated ß = 0.40, 95% CI: \\x961.01, 1.75). Age and pain medication use were not significantly associated with pain. Model 1 accounted for 4.7% and model 2 for 7.2% of the variance in self-reported pain. Conclusion: The number, location, and severity of fractures do not appear to be the primary explanation for pain in women with vertebral fractures. Clinicians must consider other factors contributing to pain.'],\n",

Most published MM-GT provided little methodological detail regarding grounded theory, mixed methods, and their integration; theoretical development was noticeably absent; and the majority followed a convergent mixed methods design.

       "  '(0.595)  Background: Qualitative research methods are increasingly being used across disciplines because of their ability to help investigators understand the perspectives of participants in their own words. However, qualitative analysis is a laborious and resource-intensive process. To achieve depth, researchers are limited to smaller sample sizes when analyzing text data. One potential method to address this concern is natural language processing (NLP). Qualitative text analysis involves researchers reading data, assigning code labels, and iteratively developing findings; NLP has the potential to automate part of this process. Unfortunately, little methodological research has been done to compare automatic coding using NLP techniques and qualitative coding, which is critical to establish the viability of NLP as a useful, rigorous analysis procedure. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of a traditional qualitative text analysis, an NLP analysis, and an augmented approach that combines qualitative and NLP methods. Methods: We conducted a 2-arm cross-over experiment to compare qualitative and NLP approaches to analyze data generated through 2 text (short message service) message survey questions, one about prescription drugs and the other about police interactions, sent to youth aged 14-24 years. We randomly assigned a question to each of the 2 experienced qualitative analysis teams for independent coding and analysis before receiving NLP results. A third team separately conducted NLP analysis of the same 2 questions. We examined the results of our analyses to compare (1) the similarity of findings derived, (2) the quality of inferences generated, and (3) the time spent in analysis. Results: The qualitative-only analysis for the drug question (n=58) yielded 4 major findings, whereas the NLP analysis yielded 3 findings that missed contextual elements. The qualitative and NLP-augmented analysis was the most comprehensive. For the police question (n=68), the qualitative-only analysis yielded 4 primary findings and the NLP-only analysis yielded 4 slightly different findings. Again, the augmented qualitative and NLP analysis was the most comprehensive and produced the highest quality inferences, increasing our depth of understanding (ie, details and frequencies). In terms of time, the NLP-only approach was quicker than the qualitative-only approach for the drug (120 vs 270 minutes) and police (40 vs 270 minutes) questions. An approach beginning with qualitative analysis followed by qualitative- or NLP-augmented analysis took longer time than that beginning with NLP for both drug (450 vs 240 minutes) and police (390 vs 220 minutes) questions. Conclusions: NLP provides both a foundation to code qualitatively more quickly and a method to validate qualitative findings. NLP methods were able to identify major themes found with traditional qualitative analysis but were not useful in identifying nuances. Traditional qualitative text analysis added important details and context.',\n",

       "  '(0.537)  BACKGROUND: Given the history of unethical research in Indigenous communities, there is often apprehension among Indigenous communities toward research carried out by non-Indigenous researchers. We examined the approaches, experiences and motivations among non-Indigenous researchers at a research-intensive Canadian university conducting research with Indigenous communities to understand approaches to ethical research with Indigenous peoples. METHODS: We performed a critical constructivist qualitative study incorporating decolonizing methodologies. We conducted semistructured interviews with 8 non-Indigenous University of Toronto researchers with a research focus/interest related to Indigenous health between August and October 2017. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed through an iterative process. Shared experiences among the researchers were arranged into primary themes. RESULTS: We identified 4 primary themes related to the conduct of Indigenous research by non-Indigenous researchers: 1) relationships with communities are foundational to the research process, 2) non-Indigenous researchers experience a personal self-reflective journey grounded in reconciliation, allyship and privilege, 3) accepted knowledge frameworks in Indigenous research are familiar to most but are inconsistently applied and 4) institutions act as barriers to and facilitators of ethical conduct of Indigenous research. Four core principles - relationships, trust, humility and accountability - unified the primary themes. INTERPRETATION: We identified strengths and areas for improvement of current policies and practices in Indigenous research by non-Indigenous researchers. Although non-Indigenous researchers value relationships, and their research is informed by Indigenous knowledge, institutional barriers to implementing recommended elements exist, and certain policy statements such as the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2 lack applicability to secondary data analysis for some non-Indigenous researchers.',\n",

Yet, only a paucity of empirical studies addresses the topic of teaching and learning mixed methods. Our current understanding of how to distinguish novices from experts at mixed methods, an important question for instructors and mentors, is anecdotal. While related literature tends to focus on teaching mixed methods research, this study took a different perspective. I used a proficiency framework to explore the skills needed to conduct mixed methods research as identified by experienced researchers, mixed methods curricula, and the mixed methods literature and to develop a typology of mixed methods proficiency. Data collection involved multiple data sources: qualitative interviews (n\\xa0=\\xa08) with individuals highly regarded for their expertise in mixed methods research and documents in the form of course syllabi, curricula materials, and workshop materials. I then conducted theme-based and type-building text analysis of the data. Four themes emerged: mixed methods skills, knowledge, researcher characteristics, and professional experiences. This article presents a typology of descriptors at three levels of mixed methods proficiency: novices, researchers, and methodologists. The proficiency typology and resultant understanding of what distinguishes mixed methods experts will be useful to learners, instructors, and mentors in developing courses, workshops, and professional development plans.'],\n",

The objective of this research was to understand how clinical researchers of different skill levels include variables in a case report form for their clinical research. Setting The setting for this research was a major academic institution in Beijing, China. Participants The target population was clinical researchers with three levels of experience, namely, limited clinical research experience, clinicians with rich clinical research experience and clinical research experts. Methods Using a qualitative approach, we conducted 13 individual interviews (face to face) and one group interview (n=4) with clinical researchers from June to September 2016. Based on maximum variation sampling to identify researchers with three levels of research experience: eight clinicians with limited clinical research experience, five clinicians with rich clinical research experience and four clinical research experts. These 17 researchers had diverse hospital-based medical specialties and or specialisation in clinical research. Results Our analysis yields a typology of three processes developing a case report form that varies according to research experience level. Novice clinician researchers often have an incomplete protocol or none at all, and conduct data collection and publication based on a general framework. Experienced clinician researchers include variables in the case report form based on previous experience with attention to including domains or items at risk for omission and by eliminating unnecessary variables. Expert researchers consider comprehensively in advance data collection and implementation needs and plan accordingly. Conclusion These results illustrate increasing levels of sophistication in research planning that increase sophistication in selection for variables in the case report form. These findings suggest that novice and intermediate-level researchers could benefit by emulating the comprehensive planning procedures such as those used by expert clinical researchers.',\n",

We aimed to better understand their clinical reasoning using dual cognition as a guiding theory. Methods EM junior doctors were recruited from six hospitals in the south of England to participate in semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus groups (n=17) based on recall of two recent cases. Transcripts were analysed using a grounded theory approach to identify themes and to develop a model of junior doctors' clinical reasoning in EM. Results Within cases, clinical reasoning occurred in three phases. In phase 1 (case framing), initial case cues and first impressions were predominantly intuitive, but checked by analytical thought and determined the urgency of clinical assessment. In phase 2 (evolving reasoning), non-analytical single cue and pattern recognitions were common which were subsequently validated by specific analytical strategies such as use of red flags. In phase 3 (ongoing uncertainty) analytical self-monitoring and reassurance strategies were used to precipitate a decision regarding discharge. Conclusion We found a constant dialectic between intuitive and analytical cognition throughout the reasoning process. Our model of clinical reasoning by EM junior doctors illustrates the specific contextual manifestations of the dual cognition theory. Distinct diagnostic strategies are identified and together these give EM learners and educators a framework and vocabulary for discussion and learning about clinical reasoning.\",\n",
       "  '(0.543)  Background: Clinical academic nursing roles are rare, and clinical academic leadership positions even more scarce. Amongst the United Kingdom (UK) academia, only 3% of nurses who are employed within universities are clinically active. Furthermore, access to research fellowships and research grant funding for nurses in clinical or academic practice is also limited. The work of Florence Nightingale, the original role model for clinical academic nursing, is discussed in terms of how this has shaped and influenced that of clinical academic nurse leaders in modern UK healthcare settings. We analysed case studies with a view to providing exemplars and informing a new model by which to visualise a trajectory of clinical academic careers. Methods: A Framework analysis of seven exemplar cases was conducted for a network of Clinical Academic Nursing Professors (n\\xa0=\\xa07), using a structured template. Independent analysis highlighted shared features of the roles: (a) model of clinical academic practice, (b) infrastructure for the post, (c) capacity-building initiatives, (d) strategic influence, (e) wider influence, (f) local and national implementation initiatives, (g) research area and focus and (h) impact and contribution. Findings: All seven of the professors of nursing involved in this discourse were based in both universities and healthcare organisations in an equal split.

We outline a model for career trajectories in clinical academia, and how leadership is crucial. Conclusion: The model outlined emphasises the different stages of clinical academic roles in nursing. Nursing as a discipline needs to embrace the value of these roles, which have great potential to raise the standards of healthcare and the status of the profession.'],\n",

       "  '(0.563)  Background: Understanding factors that influence public support for \\x93nudging\\x94 policies, like pictorial cigarette pack warnings, may offer insight about how to increase such support. We sought to examine factors that influence smokers\\x92 support for requiring pictorial warnings on cigarette packs. Methods: In 2014 and 2015, we randomly assigned 2149 adult US smokers to receive either pictorial warnings or text-only warnings on their cigarette packs for 4\\xa0weeks. The outcome examined in the current study was support for a policy requiring pictorial warnings on cigarette packs in the US. Results: Support for pictorial warnings was high at baseline (mean: 3.2 out of 4). Exposure to pictorial warnings increased policy support at week 4 (ß\\xa0=\\xa0.05, p\\xa0=\\xa0.03). This effect was explained by increases in perceived message effectiveness (p\\xa0<\\xa0.001) and reported conversations about policy support (p\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Message reactance (i.e., an oppositional reaction to the warning) partially diminished the impact of pictorial warnings on policy support (p\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Conclusions: Exposing people to a new policy through implementation could increase public support for that policy by increasing perceived effectiveness and by prompting conversations about the policy. Reactance may partially weaken the effect of policy exposure on public support.',\n",

We report the results of an on-line survey administered in late 2016 in Great Britain (N = 1667 with a response rate of 35\\x9650%). The survey allowed for testing the sensitivity of public opinion across two other variables: absolute versus relative (everyone should have the same versus inequality should be reduced) and bivariate versus univariate (inequality in one domain is judged in relation to inequality in another versus inequality in a domain is judged independently of other domains). It also allowed examination of how far support for equality in one domain overlaps with support for equality in another. We find that for health, economic and political equality a relative conception of equality attracts more support than an absolute conception, and that for health and political equality a bivariate conception attracts more support than a univariate conception. We also find that conceptions of equality affect how much overlap exists between support for different forms of equality, with a bivariate and relative conception resulting in more overlap than a univariate and absolute conception. We also find evidence for Walzer's \\x91complex equality\\x92 theory in which people tolerate inequality in one domain if it does not control inequality in another.\",\n",

Few large-scale studies have described the views of suicide-bereaved people regarding their needs for support. Our objective was to explore the nature of young adults\\x92 experiences of support after bereavement by suicide and their views on valued and unhelpful aspects. We conducted a cross-sectional study of staff and students aged 18-40 at 37 United Kingdom (UK) higher educational institutions in 2010, eliciting qualitative responses to two questions probing experiences of support and unmet needs after the suicide of a close contact. We conducted thematic analysis of responses from 420 adults bereaved by suicide, of whom 75% had received support after the loss. We identified three broad descriptive areas corresponding to important aspects of support: value and experiences of the support received; views on specific support needs; and reasons for not seeking support. We found that needs for emotional support exist throughout the social networks of people who die by suicide but are often hidden. Our findings suggest a need for proactive offers of support from family, friends, and professionals after suicide, repeated regularly in case a bereaved person does not feel ready for support early on.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to assess computer use and Internet access in peer support agencies. Method: A peer-assisted survey assessed the frequency with which consumers in all 13 New Hampshire peer support centers (n - 702) used computers to access Internet resources. During the 30-day survey period, 200 of the 702 peer support consumers (28%) responded to the survey.

Future research should assess facilitators and barriers to use of Web-based resources among people with severe mental illness in peer support centers.'],\n",
       " [\"(0.603)  Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, with the need for 'strong action' highlighted by the Chief Medical Officer for England in 2013, along with a 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy. Objectives: Five years on, we set out to determine if there was a measurable impact from the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy on overall antibiotic prescribing in NHS primary care in England. Methods: We calculated the volume of antibiotic prescription items using annual prescription cost analysis data from 1998 to 2017 and monthly prescribing data from October 2010 to June 2018. Antibiotic prescribing rate was calculated using an age- and sex-adjusted denominator (Specific Therapeutic group Age-sex Related Prescribing Units, STAR-PU). We conducted interrupted time series analysis to measure any change in prescribing rate after the intervention. Results: After several years with a stable rate of antibiotic prescribing, there was a downward change in gradient after 2013: -46.4 items per 1000 STAR-PU per year (95% CI=-61.4 to -31.3). The prescribing rate dropped from 1378 per 1000 STAR-PU per year in 2013 to 1184 in 2017, representing a 14.1% reduction. The reduction is similar for monthly data (16.4%). Assuming causality, when compared with predicted prescribing if the rate of prescribing had continued at the pre-2013 trend, we estimate that 9.7 million antibiotic prescriptions were prevented over the past year by the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy. Conclusions: Though we cannot firmly attribute causality for the reduction in prescribing to the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy, the magnitude and timing of the change are noteworthy; the substantial change followed a long period of relatively static antibiotic prescribing.\",\n",

Aim: To describe between-country differences in RTI management, particularly diagnostic testing and antibiotic prescribing, and investigate which factors relate to antibiotic prescribing and GPs\\x92 prescribing confidence. Design & setting: Prospective audit in 18 European countries. Method: An audit of GP-registered patient, clinical, and management characteristics for patients presenting with sore throat and/or lower RTI (n = 4982), and GPs' confidence in their antibiotic prescribing decision. Factors related to antibiotic prescribing and confidence were analysed using multi-level logistic regression. Results: Antibiotic prescribing proportions varied considerably: <20% in four countries, and >40% in six countries. There was also considerable variation in point-of care (POC) testing (0% in Croatia, Moldova, and Romania, and >65% in Denmark and Norway, mainly for C-reactive protein [CRP] and group A streptococcal [strep A] infection), and in laboratory or hospital-based testing (<3% in Hungary, the Netherlands, and Spain, and >30% in Croatia, Georgia, Greece, and Moldova, mainly chest X-ray and white blood cell counting). Antibiotic prescribing was related to illness severity, comorbidity, age, fever, and country, but not to having performed a POC test. In nearly 90% of consultations, GPs were confident in their antibiotic prescribing decision. Conclusion: Despite high confidence in decisions about antibiotic prescribing, there is considerable variation in the primary care of RTI in European countries, with GPs prescribing antibiotics overall more often than is considered appropriate. POC testing may enhance the quality of antibiotic prescribing decisions if it can safely reverse decisions confidently made on clinical grounds alone to prescribe\",\n",
       "  '(0.552)  Background Most antibiotics are prescribed in primary care. Locum or sessional GPs (locums) are perceived as contributing to higher prescribing and may face barriers to engaging with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Aim To identify how locums\\x92 antibiotic prescribing compares with other general practice prescribers, and how they perceive their role in antibiotic prescribing and AMS. Design and setting Mixed-methods study in primary care. Method Data on antibiotic prescribing, diagnoses, and patient and prescriber characteristics were extracted from The Health Improvement Network database. A mixed-effects logistic model was used to compare locums\\x92 and other prescribers\\x92 antibiotic prescribing for conditions that do not usually benefit from antibiotics. Nineteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with locums in England and analysed thematically. Results Locums accounted for 11% of consultations analysed. They prescribed antibiotics more often than other GPs and nurse prescribers for acute cough, sore throat, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, and acute bronchitis. The number of patients receiving antibiotics for these conditions was 4% higher (on absolute scale) when consulting with locums compared with when they consulted with other GPs. Four themes capture the perceived influences on prescribing antibiotics and AMS: antibiotic prescribing as a complex but individual issue, nature and patterns of locum work, relationships between practices and locums, and professional isolation. Conclusion Locums contribute to higher antibiotic prescribing compared with their peers. They experience challenges but also opportunities for contributing to AMS, which should be better addressed. With an increasing proportion of locums in general practice, they have an important role in antibiotic optimisation and AMS.',\n",

Objectives: To describe antibiotic prescribing trends in NHS England primary care for the years 1998-2017 using various measures. We investigated trends and variation between practices and geographical areas, out-of-hours prescribing, and seasonality. Methods: We used publicly available prescribing datasets and calculated antibiotic prescribing rates per 1000 age-sex-adjusted population units, percentage prescribed as broad-spectrum, and course length.We report national time trends for 1998-2016, geographical variation across 2017 and variation trends for 2010-17. We calculated percentiles and ranges, and plotted maps. Results: The overall rate of antibiotic prescribing has reduced by 18% since 2010, with the steepest decline since 2013. The percentage prescribed as broad-spectrum declined since 2006, from 18.0 to 8.4. Between the best and worst Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) there was 2-fold variation for total antibiotic prescribing, but 7- fold variation for cephalosporins. Variation across general practices has declined. The CCG to which a practice belongs accounted for 12.6% of current variation (P,0.0001). Higher antibiotic prescribing was associated with greater practice size, proportion of patients .65 years or ,18 years, ruralness and deprivation. Seasonal increases have been declining for most antibiotics. If every practice prescribed antibiotics at the lowest decile rate in 2017, 10.8 million fewer prescriptions could have been issued (34%). Compared with standard practices, out-of-hours practices prescribed a greater proportion of broad-spectrumantibiotics. Conclusions: Despite a general trend towards more optimal antibiotic prescribing, considerable geographical variation persists across England's practices and CCGs.\",\n",

Methods: This is a review of routinely collected patient data extracted from computerised medical records from 39 general practices in eastern metropolitan Melbourne over a 5-year period, 2010\\x962014. Main outcome measures: Proportion of paediatric consultations resulting in antibiotic prescription, type and frequency of antibiotics prescribed, antibiotic prescribing stratified by age, reason for indication and inter-practice variation. Results: There were 744 883 consultations for 89 983 individual paediatric patients and 85 913 prescriptions for antibiotics during the study period. Of these antibiotic prescriptions, 75 410 were associated with a consultation, and 10 503 (12.2% of all prescriptions) had no associated consultation in the data. On average, one in five individual children was prescribed an antibiotic each year. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cephalexin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, phenoxymethylpenicillin and roxithromycin. Less than 3% of all prescriptions were for amoxycillin. Prescribing of cefaclor and roxithromycin decreased, although cefaclor remained the third most common antibiotic choice for general practitioners. Peaks in prescribing were noted over winter months. Reason for prescription was not recorded for 82% of prescriptions. The frequency of antibiotic prescription per consultation varied substantially (2.1\\x9619.7%) between general practitioner clinics. Overall, antibiotic prescribing decreased by 2.3% over the 5-year period. Conclusions: This study provides a focused examination of antibiotic prescribing practices for children in Australian general practice. More information is required to better understand specific prescribing practices in children, including the low frequency of amoxycillin prescription and ongoing prescription of cefaclor.'],\n",

To inform this debate, we analyzed Medicare fee-for-service claims for the period 2004-14 to understand trends in and recent use of telemedicine for mental health care, also known as telemental health. The study population consisted of rural beneficiaries with a diagnosis of any mental illness or serious mental illness. The number of telemental health visits grew on average 45.1 percent annually, and by 2014 there were 5.3 and 11.8 telemental health visits per 100 rural beneficiaries with any mental illness or serious mental illness, respectively. There was notable variation across states: In 2014 nine had more than twenty-five visits per 100 beneficiaries with serious mental illness, while four states and the District of Columbia had none. Compared to other beneficiaries with mental illness, beneficiaries who received a telemental health visit were more likely to be younger than sixty-five, be eligible for Medicare because of disability, and live in a relatively poor community. States with a telemedicine parity law and a pro-telemental health regulatory environment had significantly higher rates of telemental health use than those that did not.',\n",
       "  '(0.526)  In the previous accompanying paper, we described geopolitical factors which affect mental health of individuals who suffer directly and indirectly. These disasters whether they are natural or man-made often attract significant amounts of aid and resources \\x96 financial and human. In addition, those who offer foreign aid need to be aware of where and how the aid is being spent. In this paper, we propose that aid giving agencies give due attention to the impact the aid should have on mental health of recipients. Global mental health has become a movement, but concerns remain about its efficacy. Therefore, it is imperative that any aid given is given and utilised in a culturally appropriate and culturally sensitive way. In an interconnected and interlinked world, it is likely that when one country or nation is affected by disasters or trauma, it will impact upon others around both directly and indirectly. We present a new measurement tool-CAPE Vulnerability Index which can be used to identify most vulnerable communities so that international aid may be more appropriately targeted. We believe that this index may go some way in assisting governments and policymakers in ascertaining the impact of their aid on the emotional and mental health of individuals. We suggest that their needs to be a ring-fencing of aid to ensure that population mental health is protected and enhanced with a strategic approach inbuilt into the foreign policy the focus needs to shift towards public mental health.',\n",

RESULTS: The GPs with mental health training saw significantly more patients with mental health problems per week (median class 11-15 versus 6-10) and treated a higher percentage of patients with mental health problems (median class 41-60% versus 21-40%). The differences remained significant, with odds ratios of 2.6 for both indicators after controlling for gender, healthcare setting and years of practice.

Estimated from the results, GPs with mental health training have nearly triple the number of consultations related to mental health, compared with other GPs (340 versus 120 per year).'],\n",
       " ['(0.562)  Background Hospital patients who use illicit opioids such as heroin may use drugs during an admission or leave the hospital in order to use drugs. There have been reports of patients found dead from drug poisoning on the hospital premises or shortly after leaving the hospital. This study examines whether hospital admission and discharge are associated with increased risk of opioid-related death. Methods and findings We conducted a case-crossover study of opioid-related deaths in England. Our study included 13,609 deaths between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 among individuals aged 18 to 64. For each death, we sampled 5 control days from the period 730 to 28 days before death. We used data from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database to determine the time proximity of deaths and control days to hospital admissions. We estimated the association between hospital admission and opioid-related death using conditional logistic regression, with a reference category of time neither admitted to the hospital nor within 14 days of discharge. A total of 236/13,609 deaths (1.7%) occurred following drug use while admitted to the hospital. The risk during hospital admissions was similar or lower than periods neither admitted to the hospital nor recently discharged, with odds ratios 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; p = 0.75) for the first 14 days of an admission and 0.41 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.56; p < 0.001) for days 15 onwards. 1,088/13,609 deaths (8.0%) occurred in the 14 days after discharge. The risk of opioid-related death increased in this period, with odds ratios of 4.39 (95% CI 3.75 to 5.14; p < 0.001) on days 1 to 2 after discharge and 2.09 (95% CI 1.92 to 2.28; p < 0.001) on days 3 to 14. 11,629/13,609 deaths (85.5%) did not occur close to a hospital admission, and the remaining 656/13,609 deaths (4.8%) occurred in hospital following admission due to drug poisoning. Risk was greater for patients discharged from psychiatric admissions, those who left the hospital against medical advice, and those leaving the hospital after admissions of 7 days or more. The main limitation of the method is that it does not control for time-varying health or drug use within individuals; therefore, hospital admissions coinciding with high-risk periods may in part explain the results. Conclusions Discharge from the hospital is associated with an acute increase in the risk of opioid-related death, and 1 in 14 opioid-related deaths in England happens in the 2 weeks after the hospital discharge. This supports interventions that prevent early discharge and improve linkage with community drug treatment and harm reduction services.',\n",

In Canada, updated labelling standards were implemented in October 2009 and September 2016, with the intent of communicating risks of overdose and facilitating product identification and safe use, respectively. Full compliance with the 2016 standards was expected by March 2018. We sought to explore whether these changes affected rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of hospital admissions for accidental acetaminophen overdose in 9 Canadian provinces and 3 Canadian territories between Apr. 1, 2004, and Mar. 31, 2020. We used interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to evaluate the impact of the updated labelling standards on rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose. In secondary analyses, we studied intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and hospital admissions for accidental acetaminophen overdose involving opioids. Results: Monthly rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose were essentially unchanged over the study period (0.21 and 0.22 cases per 100000 population in April 2004 and March 2020, respectively). We found no association between changing labelling standards and trends in rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose (October 2009 p = 0.2, September 2016 p = 0.7 and March 2018 p = 0.2). Similarly, labelling changes did not have an impact on admissions involving ICU admission and concomitant opioid poisoning.',\n",

Clinicians and policy experts have raised concerns that the 30-day readmission measure used in this program provides an incomplete picture of performance because it does not capture all hospital encounters that may occur after discharge. In contrast, the excess days in acute care (EDAC) measure, which currently is not used in the HRRP, captures the full spectrum of hospital encounters (emergency department, observation stay, inpatient readmission) and their associated lengths of stay within 30 days of discharge. This study of 3173 hospitals that participated in the HRRP in fiscal year 2019 compared performance on the readmission and EDAC measures and evaluated whether using the EDAC measure would change hospitals' penalty status for 3 conditions targeted by the HRRP. Overall, only moderate agreement was found on hospital performance rankings by using the readmission and EDAC measures (weighted _ statistic: Heart failure, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.47]; acute myocardial infarction [AMI], 0.37 [CI, 0.35 to 0.40]; and pneumonia, 0.50 [CI, 0.47 to 0.52]). Under the HRRP, the penalty status of 769 (27.0%) of 2845 hospitals for heart failure, 581 (28.3%) of 2055 for AMI, and 724 (24.9%) of 2911 for pneumonia would change if the EDAC measure were used instead of the readmission measure to evaluate performance. Fewer small and rural hospitals would receive penalties. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should consider using the EDAC measure, which provides a more comprehensive picture of postdischarge hospital use, rather than the 30-day readmission measure to evaluate health care system performance under federal quality, reporting, and value-based programs.\",\n",

About 1300 of them are investor-owned, for-profit hospitals whose owners are corporations, groups of physicians, or other private entities. Private equity firms use capital from individuals and institutions to invest in organizations. They are increasingly buying hospitals, which they typically plan to sell for a profit within 3 to 7 years after acquisition (1, 2). A recent study evaluated changes in hospital income, use, and quality associated with private equity acquisitions between 2005 and 2017 (2). Objective: To compare acute care hospitals owned by private equity firms with similarly sized and located hospitals not owned by private equity firms in 2018. Methods and Findings: We used merger and acquisition reports by Irving Levin Associates and public information to identify 130 hospitals under private equity control in 2018. We then identified all 2868 hospitals that had a full year of data in the 2018 Medicare Cost Report, extracted information on size (1 to 49 beds, 50 to 450 beds, and =451 beds), and assigned the hospitals to health care markets (hospital referral regions) using The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. We used health care markets and size groups to identify 688 hospitals that we could match to a private equity hospital. Within matched groups, there were 1 to 56 matched control hospitals per private equity hospital, with a median of 8 control hospitals and an interquartile range of 10. We assigned each private equity hospital a weight of 1 and assigned its matched hospitals' weights that summed to 1. We used these weights in all analyses.\",\n",

We use routine hospital admissions data and time-series modelling analysis to estimate the impact of the seven and thirteen valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) on hospital admissions due to pneumococcal disease in England. Methods: Hospital admissions for pneumococcal meningitis, bacteraemia and pneumonia between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2015 were identified from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database for all age groups in England. We model the impact of pneumococcal vaccination using interrupted time series analysis. Hospital admissions prior to vaccine introduction were extrapolated to predict the expected number of admissions in the absence of pneumococcal vaccines. Admissions avoided over time were estimated by comparing the fitted interrupted time series and the expected model for no vaccination in a Bayesian framework. Results: Overall, there were 43,531 (95% credible interval (CrI): 36486-51,346) fewer hospital admissions due to bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia in England during the period from 2006 to 2015 than would have been expected if pneumococcal vaccines had not been implemented, with the majority of hospital admissions avoided due to pneumonia. Among young children reductions in meningitis were more common, while among adults reductions in pneumonia admissions were relatively more important, with no evidence for reduced bacteraemia and meningitis among older adults. We estimated that 981 (95% CrI: 391-2018), 749 (95% CrI: 295-1442) and 1464 (95% CrI: 793-2522) bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia related hospital admissions, respectively, were averted in children < 2 years of age.

       " [\"(0.557)  Purpose: Little is known about the views of U.S. youth on COVID-19 or their use of face coverings. Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. Methods: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14\\x9624 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. Results: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. Conclusions: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.\",\n",

To maximize the uptake and reach of this promising strategy and inform intervention development and scale up, research is needed to understand the acceptability of and willingness to use this tool. This is vital to ensure that Black/African Americans are reached by the Biden-Harris Administration\\x92s free national COVID-19 ST program. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and recommendations to promote and scale-up the uptake of COVID-19 ST among Black/African Americans. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study using a semi-structured questionnaire to assess barriers and facilitators to the uptake of COVID-19 ST among a convenience sample of 28 self-identified Black/African Americans from schools, community centers, and faith-based institutions in Ohio and Maryland. Inductive content analysis was conducted to identify categories and subcategories related to acceptability and recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST in communities. Results: Participants perceived COVID-19 self-testing as an acceptable tool that is beneficial to prevent transmission and address some of the barriers associated with health facility testing, such as transportation cost and human contact at the health facility. However, concerns were raised regarding the accurate use of the kits and costs. Recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST included engagement of community stakeholders to disseminate information about COVID-19 self-testing and creating culturally appropriate education tools to promote knowledge of and clear instructions about how to properly use COVID-19 ST kits. Based on these recommendations, the COVID-19 STEP (Self-Testing Education and Promotion) Project is being developed and will involve engaging community partners such as barbers, church leaders, and other community-based organizations to increase the uptake and use of free COVID-19 ST kits among Black/African Americans. Conclusion: Findings showed that most participants considered COVID-19 ST valuable for encouraging COVID-19 testing. However, cost and accuracy concerns may pose barriers. Future work should consider implementing interventions that leverage the benefits of COVID-19 ST and further assess the extent to which these identified facilitators and barriers may influence COVID-19 ST uptake.',\n",
       "  '(0.452)  Objective: This study was aimed to assess the perceived fear of COVID-19 and its associated factors among older adults in Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2020 among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults aged =60 years. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants\\x92 characteristics and COVID-19 related information. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), where the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with perceived fear of COVID-19. Results: The mean fear score was 19.4. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 (ß: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.78) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 (ß: 3.31, 95% CI: 2.33 to 4.29) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Moreover, older adults who felt themselves isolated from others and whose close friends and family members were diagnosed with COVID-19 were more fearful. However, the participants who received COVID-19 related information from the health workers had a lower level of fear (ß: -1.90, 95% CI: - 3.06 to - 0.73). Conclusions: The presence of overwhelming fear of COVID-19 among the older adults of Bangladesh underlines the psychological needs of these vulnerable groups. Health workers have a key role in addressing these needs and further research is needed to identify the effective strategies for them to use.',\n",
       "  '(0.452)  Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of nonessential businesses have been central to COVID19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases and deaths, and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.'],\n",

Materials and methods: We conducted a non-randomized study evaluating treatment data for patients in outpatient treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) at a private clinic. Patients who were HCV-positive, had been in OUD treatment for at least 4 weeks, and engaged in integrated HCV treatment with DAA (co-located within their treatment for OUD) were compared to patients with HCV who only received OUD treatment. We evaluated HCV cure; OUD medication adherence, treatment utilization and retention; and illicit substance use for those engaged in treatment between 9/2016 and 1/2018. Results: Seventy-four patients completed integrated HCV-OUD treatment with DAA, with 87.8% achieving cure. Of the 66 who completed treatment and were subsequently evaluated for sustained viral response 98.5% were cured. Patients who received integrated HCV and OUD treatment in our clinic, stayed in OUD treatment longer, demonstrated higher OUD medication adherence, and used less opioids or cocaine compared to HCV-infected patients (n = 572) being treated only for OUD. Discussion: We have reported on a reproducible intervention that lends itself to outpatient OUD treatment. Analyses demonstrate the potential positive impact HCV treatment has on OUD recovery, including reduction in opioid and cocaine use and increased retention in care Conclusion: Co-locating HCV treatment with existing OUD treatment is feasible, effective, and demonstrates positive outcomes for the treatment of both conditions.',\n",
       "  '(0.487)  The COVID-19 pandemic has required novel solutions, including heat disinfection of personal protective equipment (PPE) for potential reuse to ensure availability for healthcare and other frontline workers. Understanding the efficacy of such methods on pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 that may be present on PPE in healthcare settings is key to worker safety, as some pathogenic bacteria are more heat resistant than SARS-CoV-2. We assessed the efficacy of dry heat treatment against Clostridioides difficile spores and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) on filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) coupons in two inoculums. Soil load (mimicking respiratory secretions) and deionized water was used for C. difficile, whereas, soil load and PBS and Tween mixture was used for M. tb. Dry heat treatment at 85 °C for 240 min resulted in a reduction equivalent to 6.0-log10 CFU and 7.3-log10 CFU in C. difficile spores inoculated in soil load and deionized water, respectively. Conversely, treatment at 75 °C for 240 min led to 4.6-log10 CFU reductions in both soil load and deionized water. C. difficile inactivation was higher by >1.5-log10 CFU in deionized water as compared to soil load (p < 0.0001), indicating the latter has a protective effect on bacterial spore inactivation at 85 °C. For M. tb, heat treatment at 75 °C for 90 min and 85 °C for 30 min led to 8-log10 reduction with or without soil load. Heat treatment near the estimated maximal operating temperatures of FFR materials (which would readily eliminate SARS-CoV-2) did not achieve complete inactivation of C. difficile spores but was successful against M. tb. The clinical relevance of surviving C. difficile spores when subjected to heat treatment remains unclear. Given this, any disinfection method of PPE for potential reuse must ensure the discarding of any PPE, potentially contaminated with C. difficile spores, to ensure the safety of healthcare workers.',\n",
       "  '(0.468)  In intensive care, disputes sometimes arise when patients or surrogates strongly desire treatment, yet health professionals regard it as potentially inappropriate. While professional guidelines confirm that physicians are not always obliged to provide requested treatment, determining when treatment would be inappropriate is extremely challenging. One potential reason for refusing to provide a desired and potentially beneficial treatment is because (within the setting of limited resources) this would harm other patients. Elsewhere in public health systems, cost effectiveness analysis is sometimes used to decide between different priorities for funding. In this paper, we explore whether cost-effectiveness could be used to determine the appropriateness of providing intensive care. We explore a set of treatment thresholds: the probability threshold (a minimum probability of survival for providing treatment), the cost threshold (a maximum cost of treatment), the duration threshold (the maximum duration of intensive care), and the quality threshold (a minimum quality of life). One common objection to cost-effectiveness analysis is that it might lead to rationing of life-saving treatment. The analysis in this paper might be used to inform debate about the implications of applying cost-effectiveness thresholds to clinical decisions around potentially inappropriate treatment.',\n",

Well-characterized gaps in chronic HCV diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment have resulted in fewer than 5% of PWID receiving HCV treatment. While interferon-based treatment may have intentionally been foregone during part of this time in anticipation of improved oral therapies, the overall pattern points to deficiencies and treatment exclusions in the health care system. Treatment for HCV with all-oral, highly effective direct-acting antiviral medication for 12 weeks or less is now the standard of care, putting renewed focus on effective delivery of care. We describe here both the need for and process of chronic HCV care under the roof of addiction medicine.',\n",
       "  '(0.462)  The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis is multifactorial and ammonia is thought to play a key role. Astroglial dysfunction is known to be present in HE. Astrocytes are extensively connected by gap junctions formed of connexins, which also exist as functional hemichannels allowing exchange of molecules between the cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu. The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis suggests that neuronal activity is fueled (at least in part) by lactate provided by neighboring astrocytes. We hypothesized that in HE, astroglial dysfunction could impair metabolic communication between astrocytes and neurons. In this study, we determined whether hyperammonemia leads to hemichannel dysfunction and impairs lactate transport in the cerebral cortex using rat models of HE (bile duct ligation [BDL] and induced hyperammonemia) and also evaluated the effect of ammonia-lowering treatment (ornithine phenylacetate [OP]). Plasma ammonia concentration in BDL rats was significantly reduced by OP treatment. Biosensor recordings demonstrated that HE is associated with a significant reduction in both tonic and hypoxia-induced lactate release in the cerebral cortex, which was normalized by OP treatment. Cortical dye loading experiments revealed hemichannel dysfunction in HE with improvement following OP treatment, while the expression of key connexins was unaffected. Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate that HE is associated with central nervous system hemichannel dysfunction, with ammonia playing a key role. The data provide evidence of a potential neuronal energy deficit due to impaired hemichannel-mediated lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons as a possible mechanism underlying pathogenesis of HE.

       " ['(0.863)  Movie alcohol exposure is a known and consistent predictor of adolescent alcohol use initiation and escalation. Nearly 90% of the top U.S. movies contain alcohol content. Social- cognitive theory posits reciprocal links among environmental influences (e.g., movie alcohol exposure), social- cognitive processes (e.g., perceived norms, susceptibility, alcohol outcome expectancies), and behavior (alcohol use), but these links have been tested in only 1 direction. In the current study, we assessed movie alcohol exposure, alcohol cognitions, and alcohol initiation among adolescents (N = 1,023; 52% female, mean age = 13.7 years) in 4 annual survey waves. Cross-lagged panel models tested bidirectional relations between cognitions and movie alcohol exposure. Finally, we tested bidirectional mediation effects in the prospective prediction of alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure prospectively predicted increases in descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and susceptibility but not positive or negative alcohol outcome expectancies. All factors predicted subsequent alcohol initiation. Close friend injunctive and descriptive norms, peer descriptive norms, and susceptibility mediated the effect of earlier movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure mediated the effect of earlier close friend descriptive norms on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure and social-cognitive processes are interrelated facets that impact alcohol initiation. Permissive cognitions infrequently predicted higher subsequent exposure to movie alcohol. Clinical and preventative implications of this work are discussed.',\n",
       "  '(0.773)  Objectives. To examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol availability before and after deregulation in 2015 of the alcohol market in Ontario, Canada. Methods. We quantified alcohol access by number of alcohol outlets and hours of retail for all 19 964 neighborhoods in Ontario. We used mixed effects regression models to examine the associations between alcohol access and a validated SES index between 2013 and 2017. Results. Following deregulation, the number of alcohol outlets in Ontario increased by 15.0%. Low neighborhood SES was positively associated with increased alcohol access: lower-SES neighborhoods had more alcohol outlets within 1000 meters and were closer to the nearest alcohol outlets. Outlets located in low-SES neighborhoods kept longer hours of operation. Conclusions. We observed a substantial increase in alcohol access in Ontario following deregulation. Access to alcohol was greatest in low-SES neighborhoods and may contribute to established inequities in alcohol harms. Public Health Implications. Placing limits on number of alcohol outlets and the hours of operation in low-SES neighborhoods offers an opportunity to reduce alcohol-related health inequities.',\n",
       "  '(0.767)  Preclinical studies support an important role of dopamine D3 receptors (DRD3s) in alcohol use disorder (AUD). In animals, voluntary alcohol consumption increases DRD3 expression, and pharmacological blockade of DRD3s attenuates alcohol self-administration and reinstatement of alcohol seeking. However, these findings have yet to be translated in humans. This study used positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]-(+)-PHNO to compare receptor levels in several dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and DRD3 regions of interest between AUD subjects in early abstinence (n = 17; 6.59 ± 4.14 days of abstinence) and healthy controls (n = 18). We recruited non-treatment seeking subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for AUD. We examined the relationship between DRD2/3 levels and both alcohol craving and alcohol motivation/wanting, using a cue reactivity procedure and an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IVASA) paradigm, respectively. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels in AUD subjects were significantly lower than binding in HCs when looking at all DRD2/3 ROIs jointly (Wilk\\x92s <U+039B> =.58, F(6,28) =3.33, p = 0.013, <U+03B7>2p = 0.42), however there were no region-specific differences. Binding values demonstrate -12.3% and -16.1% lower [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SMST and SN respectively, though these differences did not withstand Bonferroni corrections. There was a positive association between [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SN (almost exclusively reflective of DRD3) and alpha (lower values reflect higher alcohol demand) in the APT after Bonferroni corrections (r = 0.66, p = 0.0080). This demonstrates that AUD subjects with lower DRD3 levels in the SN exhibit increased demand for alcohol. These results replicate previous findings demonstrating reduced DRD2/3 levels while also supporting a lack of DRD3 upregulation and potential downregulation in early abstinent AUD. Furthermore, the finding that binding in the SN is associated with alcohol demand warrants further examination.',\n",
       "  '(0.756)  Objectives: In 2015, Ontario partially deregulated alcohol sales by allowing grocery stores to sell alcohol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) whether neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) impacted the likelihood that a grocery store began selling alcohol, and (2) whether increases in alcohol retail availability following deregulation differed between neighbourhoods based on SES. Methods: This was a repeated cross-sectional analysis of 1062 grocery stores in 17,096 neighbourhoods in urban Ontario. The association between neighbourhood-level SES and whether a grocery store began selling alcohol was modeled using mixed effect logistic regression. The annual change in drive-distance from a neighbourhood to the closest off-premise alcohol outlet between 2015 and 2020 was modeled using mixed effect linear regression. An interaction between time and SES was included to evaluate whether this change differed between neighbourhoods based on SES. Results: Grocery stores in neighbourhoods in the lowest SES quintile were 39% less likely to start selling alcohol than grocery stores in neighbourhoods in the highest SES quintile (odds ratio (OR): 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39\\x960.94). As grocery store sales expanded, the distance to the closest off-premise alcohol outlet decreased by 51.8 m annually (95% CI: 48.8\\x9654.9, p < 0.01). A significant interaction between year and SES was observed whereby this trend was more pronounced in high- versus low-SES neighbourhoods. Conclusion: The expansion of grocery store alcohol sales increased alcohol availability, but this increase was proportionately larger in high- versus low-SES neighbourhoods. This reduced historic disparities in alcohol availability between low- and high-SES neighbourhoods.',\n",
       "  '(0.739)  Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption impairs neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. However, it is unknown whether alcohol produces a similar impairment of neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region that plays an important role in cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) was used for the induction and measurement of associative LTP-like neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Fifteen healthy subjects were administered PAS to the DLPFC following consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water) or placebo beverage in a within-subject cross-over design. PAS induced neuroplasticity was indexed up to 60 minutes following PAS. Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS. Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t =-2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally. Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS. Findings from the present study provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for impairment of cognitive functioning by alcohol.'],\n",
       " ['(0.466)  Background: External randomised pilot trials help researchers decide whether, and how, to do a future definitive randomised trial. The progression criteria are often prespecified to inform the interpretation of pilot trial findings and subsequent progression decision-making. We aimed to explore and understand the perspectives and experiences of key stakeholders when making progression decisions following external pilot trials. Methods: Thirty-five remote semi-structured interviews with external randomised pilot trial team members including chief investigators, trial managers, statisticians and patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives. Questions focussed on experiences and perceptions of pilot trial progression decisions and whether and how progression criteria informed this decision. Data were analysed using the framework method approach to thematic analysis. Strategies to ensure trustworthiness and rigour were used. Results: Interviews were conducted between December 2020 and July 2021. Six descriptive themes were developed to capture the experiences and perspectives of participants. These were (1) divided opinions on the value and development of progression criteria, (2) (avoiding) the potential for personal interest to influence progression criteria and progression decision-making, (3) stakeholder engagement in setting progression criteria and making progression decisions, (4) lessons learned from doing the pilot trial and their impact on progression criteria applicability, (5) other factors that inform the progression decision and (6) progression of external randomised pilot trials\\x97funding considerations and constraints. These themes were underpinned by an overarching interpretative theme \\x91a one-size approach to progression does not fit all\\x92 to describe the highly nuanced and complex decision-making process that occurs following external randomised pilot trials. The progression criteria are rarely the only consideration informing the decision to progress to future research; unanticipated events, signals of efficacy and continuity of the research team are other factors that researchers consider. Conclusions: One size does not fit all when it comes to the progression criteria and pilot trial progression. The progression criteria are only one of many considerations researchers have when deciding whether a pilot trial is feasible. External pilot trial progression is not guaranteed even when a pilot trial is considered feasible (based on the progression criteria and/or other considerations), indicating inefficiency and potential research waste.

While building OpenTrials, an open database of public trial information, we identified errors and omissions in registries, including discrepancies between descriptions of the same trial in different registries. We set out to ascertain the prevalence of discrepancies in trial completion status using a cohort of trials registered on both the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study design and setting We used matching titles and registry IDs provided by both registries to build a cohort of dualregistered trials. Completion statuses were compared; we calculated descriptive statistics on the prevalence of discrepancies. Results 11, 988 dual-registered trials were identified. 1, 496 did not provide a comparable completion status, leaving 10, 492 trials. 16.2% were discrepant on completion status. The majority of discrepancies (90.5%) were a 'completed' trial on ClinicalTrials.gov inaccurately marked as 'ongoing' on EUCTR. Overall, 33.9% of dual-registered trials described as 'ongoing' on EUCTR were listed as 'completed' on ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusion Completion status on registries is commonly inaccurate. Previous work on publication bias may underestimate non-reporting. We describe simple steps registry owners and trialists could take to improve accuracy.\",\n",
       "  '(0.429)  Background: Opportunistic recruitment in primary care is challenging due to the inherent unpredictability of incident conditions, and workload and time pressures. Many clinical trials do not recruit to target, leading to equivocal answers to research questions. Learning from the experiences of patients and recruiters to trials of incident conditions has the potential to improve recruitment and retention to future trials, thereby enhancing the quality and impact of research findings. The aim of this research was to learn from the trial experiences of UTI patients and recruiters to the Cranberry for UTI (CUTI) trial, to help plan an adequately powered trial of similar design. Methods: One-to-one semi-structured interviews were embedded within the CUTI feasibility trial, an open-label, randomised feasibility trial of cranberry extract for symptoms of acute, uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in primary care. Interviews were conducted with a sample of: CUTI trial participants; non-CUTI trial UTI patients; and, recruiters to the CUTI trial. Verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: Twenty-six patients with UTI and eight recruiters (nurses and GPs) to the CUTI trial were interviewed. Three themes were developed around: reasons for participating in research; barriers to opportunistic recruitment; and, UTI patients\\x92 experiences of trial procedures. Recruiters found that targeted electronic prompts directed at healthcare practitioners based in clinics where patients with incident conditions were likely to present (e.g. minor illness clinic) were more effective than generic prompts (e.g. desk prompts) at filtering patients from their usual clinical pathway to research clinics. Using a script to explain the delayed antibiotic trial group to patients was found to be helpful, and may have served to boost recruitment. For UTI patients, using an electronic diary to rate their symptoms was considered an acceptable medium, and often preferable to using a paper diary or mobile phone application. Conclusions: The use of targeted prompts directed at clinicians, a script to explain trial groups that may be deemed less desirable, and an appropriate diary format for patient-reported outcomes, may help to improve trial recruitment and retention.',\n",
       "  '(0.419)  Background: The generalizability of findings of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) is undermined by low or biased recruitment. Reasons for participant refusal are infrequently reported in published literature. Aims: To apply the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) to: (1) explore patient-reported reasons for declining to participate in a RCT comparing a new service model (patient-initiated appointments) with standard care (appointments scheduled by clinician) for managing blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm; (2) to explore associations between decliners\\x92 perceptions of acceptability and non-participation. Method: Eligible patients (n = 242) were approached to participate in the trial. Phase 1: decliners provided a brief reason for refusal. Reasons were analysed descriptively and reviewed against TFA constructs. Phase 2: Consecutive decliners participated in short semi-structured interviews, to explore their reasons for refusal in more depth. Interviews were transcribed and analysed, with the TFA as a coding framework. Results: Eighty-seven (36%) eligible patients refused trial participation; all provided a reason. From interviews with 15 decliners (17%), four key beliefs about acceptability were identified: happy with standard care (n = 41) (49%), anticipated burden of patient-initiated service, lack of confidence in ability to engage with new service and uncertainties about effectiveness of new service. Two themes reflected non-TFA factors: trial participation a low priority and burden of completing trial documentation. Conclusion: Reasons for refusal trial participation included: (a) reasons directly associated with intervention acceptability, and (b) reasons associated with trial participation more broadly. The TFA facilitated identification of problematic aspects of the new appointment booking system which could be addressed to enhance acceptability.',\n",

However, to facilitate this, we must tailor components of the HIVST kit and process to ensure that we reach and encourage youth to test. The purpose of this study to elucidate concerns and issues regarding HIVST rollout among South African youth. Methods: This study was conducted in two phases: 1) focus group discussions with rural, South African youth aged 18-24 and 2) direct observations of participants completing with an oral HIVST kit and/or a blood based HIVST kit. In phase 2a participants were invited to try both an oral and blood-based HIVST kit. In phase 2b, participants selected the HIVST kit of their choice. Results: We enrolled 35 unique participants in phase 1, 20 participants in phase 2a, and 40 participants in phase 2b. While the focus group discussions highlighted hypothetical HIVST use only, participants appreciated the privacy that the HIVST could afford them. However, they expressed concerns about whether HIVST could be trusted due to false positives and negatives, as well as whether a person would be able to emotionally handle the results if they tested alone. They suggested that the kits be used alongside someone who could provide support. In phases 2a and 2b, participants were overwhelmingly positive about both kits regarding ease of use and whether their results could be trusted. The participants, however, experienced more challenges with the blood-based versus oral test. When given the choice in phase 2b, most participants (80%) chose the oral HIVST over the blood-based HIVST. Conclusions: During the focus group discussions, participants raised concerns about the validity of HIVST, lack of emotional support when testing alone, and the cost of HIVST kits, all of which could be addressed through current testing campaigns. Most of those who actually tested had positive experiences with HIVST and would recommend it to their friends. When offered a choice, most preferred the oral test.

These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.',\n",
       "  '(0.649)  Objectives: Screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) remain suboptimal. The impact of provider strategies to enhance screening participation in the population is uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of provider strategies to increase screening in a single-payer system.Methods:A population-based survey was conducted in primary care providers (PCPs) linked to patients using administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Patients were due for CRC screening from April 2012 to March 2013. Patients were followed up until 31 March 2014. We determined time to become up-to-date with CRC screening. Cox proportional hazards models examined the association between PCP strategies and uptake of screening, adjusted for physician and patient factors.Results:A total of 717 PCPs and their 147,834 rostered patients due for CRC screening were included. Most physicians employed strategies to enhance screening participation, including electronic medical record use, reminders, generation of lists, audit and feedback reports, or designating staff responsible for screening. No single strategy was strongly associated with screening. For those >1 year overdue, a systematic approach to generate lists of patients overdue for screening was weakly associated with screening uptake (hazard ratio (HR)=1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26, P=0.04 >5 years overdue vs. <1 year overdue). The use of multiple PCP strategies was associated with screening participation (HR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.16-1.39, P<0.0001 for PCPs using 4-5 vs. 0-1 strategies). Practice-based strategies were self-reported.Conclusions: In practice, while individual PCP strategies have little effect, the use of multiple strategies to enhance screening appears to improve CRC screening uptake in patients.',\n",
       "  '(0.648)  Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underutilized by Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured. Multiple national and state policies were enacted from 2010 to 2014 to increase access to Medicaid and to promote CRC screening among Medicaid enrollees. We aimed to determine the impact of these policies on screening initiation among newly enrolled Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries age-eligible for CRC screening. Methods: We identified national and state policies affecting Medicaid coverage and preventive services in Oregon during 2010-2014. We used Oregon Medicaid claims data from 2010 to 2015 to conduct a cohort analysis of enrollees who turned 50 and became age-eligible for CRC screening (a prevention milestone, and an age at which guideline-concordant screening can be assessed within a single year) during each year from 2010 to 2014. We calculated risk ratios to assess whether first year of Medicaid enrollment and/or year turned 50 was associated with CRC screening initiation. Results: We identified 14,576 Oregon Medicaid enrollees who turned 50 during 2010-2014; 2429 (17%) completed CRC screening within 12 months after turning 50. Individuals newly enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 or 2014 were 1.58 and 1.31 times more likely, respectively, to initiate CRC screening than those enrolled by 2010. A primary care visit in the calendar year, having one or more chronic conditions, and being Hispanic was also associated with CRC screening initiation. Discussion: The increased uptake of CRC screening in 2013 and 2014 is associated with the timing of policies such as Medicaid expansion, enhanced federal matching for preventive services offered to Medicaid enrollees without cost sharing, and formation of Medicaid accountable care organizations, which included CRC screening as an incentivized quality metric.',\n",
       "  '(0.626)  Background: Kidney cancer is often asymptomatic, leading to proposals for a screening programme. The views of the public towards introducing a new screening programme for kidney cancer are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore attitudes towards kidney cancer screening and factors influencing intention to attend a future screening programme. Methods: We conducted an online population-based survey of 1021 adults aged 45\\x9677 years. The main outcome measure was intention to attend four possible screening tests (urine, blood, ultrasound scan, low-dose CT) as well as extended low-dose CT scans within lung cancer screening programmes. We used multivariable regression to examine the association between intention and each screening test. Results: Most participants stated that they would be \\x91very likely\\x92 or \\x91likely\\x92 to undergo each of the screening tests [urine test: n = 961 (94.1%); blood test: n = 922 (90.3%); ultrasound: n = 914 (89.5%); low-dose CT: n = 804 (78.8%); lung CT: n = 962 (95.2%)]. Greater intention to attend was associated with higher general cancer worry and less perceived burden/inconvenience about the screening tests. Less worry about the screening test was also associated with higher intention to attend, but only in those with low general cancer worry (cancer worry scale = 5). Compared with intention to take up screening with a urine test, participants were half as likely to report that they intended to undergo blood [OR 0.56 (0.43\\x960.73)] or ultrasound [OR 0.50 (0.38\\x960.67)] testing, and half as likely again to report that they intended to take part in a screening programme featuring a low dose CT scan for kidney cancer screening alone [OR 0.19 (0.14\\x960.27)]. Conclusion: Participants in this study expressed high levels of intention to accept an invitation to screening for kidney cancer, both within a kidney cancer specific screening programme and in conjunction with lung cancer screening. The choice of screening test is likely to influence uptake. Together these findings support on-going research into kidney cancer screening tests and the potential for combining kidney cancer screening with existing or new screening programmes.',\n",

Women\\x92s views of risk-based screening are unknown. Objective: To explore women\\x92s views and personal acceptability of a potential risk-based mammography screening paradigm. Design: Four semi-structured focus group discussions about screening mammography and surveys before provision of information about risk-based screening. We analyzed coded focus group transcripts using a mixed deductive (content analysis) and inductive (grounded theory) approach. Participants: Convenience sample of 29 women (40\\x9674\\xa0years old) with no personal history of breast cancer recruited by print and online media in New Hampshire and Vermont. Results: Twenty-seven out of 29 women reported having undergone mammography screening. All participants were white and most were highly educated. Some women accepted the idea that early cancer detection with traditional screening was beneficial\\x97although many also reported hearing inconsistent recommendations from clinicians and mixed messages from media reports about mammography. Some women were familiar with a risk-based screening paradigm (primarily related to cervical cancer, n = 8) and thought matching screening mammography frequency to personal risk made sense (n = 8). Personal acceptability of risk-based screening was mixed. Some believed risk-based screening could reduce the harms of false positives and overdiagnosis (n = 7). Others thought screening less often might result in missing a dangerous diagnosis (n = 14). Many (n = 18) expressed concerns about the feasibility of risk-based screening and questioned whether breast cancer risk estimates could be accurate. Some suspected that risk-based mammography was motivated by a desire to save money (n = 6). Conclusion: Some women thought risk-based screening made sense. Willingness to abandon traditional screening for the new paradigm was mixed. Broad acceptability of risk-based screening will require clearer communication about its rationale and feasibility and consistent messages from the health care team.'],\n",
       " ['(0.648)  Despite recent evidence that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) possesses roles in gene regulation distinct from 5-methylcytosine (5mC), relatively little is known regarding the functions of 5hmC in mammalian tissues. To address this issue, we utilized an approach combining both paired bisulfite (BS) and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) DNA treatment, to resolve genome-wide patterns of 5hmC and 5mC in normal breast tissue from disease-free women. Although less abundant than 5mC, 5hmC was differentially distributed, and consistently enriched among breast-specific enhancers and transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, regulatory regions associated with transcriptional inactivity, such as heterochromatin and repressed Polycomb regions, were relatively depleted of 5hmC. Gene regions containing abundant 5hmC were significantly associated with lactate oxidation, immune cell function, and prolactin signaling pathways. Furthermore, genes containing abundant 5hmC were enriched among those actively transcribed in normal breast tissue. Finally, in independent data sets, normal breast tissue 5hmC was significantly enriched among CpG loci demonstrated to have altered methylation in pre-invasive breast cancer and invasive breast tumors. Primarily, our findings identify genomic loci containing abundant 5hmC in breast tissues and provide a genome-wide map of nucleotide-level 5hmC in normal breast tissue. Additionally, these data suggest 5hmC may participate in gene regulatory programs that are dysregulated during breast-related carcinogenesis.',\n",
       "  '(0.631)  Background: Consistency in reporting Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density on mammograms is important because breast density is used for breast cancer risk assessment and is reported directly to women and clinicians to inform decisions about supplemental screening. Purpose: To assess the consistency of BI-RADS density reporting between digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and digital mammography (DM) and evaluate density as a breast cancer risk factor when assessed using DM versus DBT. Materials and Methods: The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium is a prospective cohort study of women undergoing mammography with DM or DBT. This secondary analysis included women aged 40-79 years who underwent at least two screening mammography examinations less than 36 months apart. Percentage agreement and k statistic were estimated for pairs of BI-RADS density assessments. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of breast density as a risk factor for invasive breast cancer. Results: A total of 403 326 pairs of mammograms from 342 149 women were evaluated. There were no significant differences in breast density assessment in pairs consisting of one DM and one DBT examination (57 516 of 74 729 [77%]; k = 0.64), two DM examinations (238 678 of 301 743 [79%]; k = 0.67), and two DBT examinations (20 763 of 26 854 [77%]; k = 0.65). Results were similar when restricting the analyses to pairs read by the same radiologist. The breast cancer HRs for breast density were similar for DM and DBT (P = .45 for interaction). The HRs for density acquired using DM and DBT, respectively, were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.63) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.66) for almost entirely fat, 1.47 (95% CI: 1.37, 1.58) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.82) for heterogeneously dense, and 1.72 (95% CI: 1.54, 1.93) and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.25, 3.36) for extremely dense breasts. Conclusion: Radiologist reporting of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System density obtained with digital breast tomosynthesis did not differ from that obtained with digital mammography.',\n",
       "  '(0.62)  Purpose: Little is known about the three-dimensional shape of breast cancer. Implicit to approaches that localize the center of the tumor for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) of non-palpable cancers is the assumption that breast cancers are spherical about a central point, which may not be accurate. Methods: Pre-operative supine breast MRI images were obtained of 83 breast cancer patients undergoing partial mastectomy using supine MRI-guided resection techniques. Three-dimensional (3D) tumor models were derived after radiologists outlined tumor edges on successive MRI slices. Ideal resection volumes were determined by adding 1\\xa0cm in every dimension to the actual tumor volume. Geometrically defined parameters were used to define tumor shapes and associations between clinical variables and shapes were examined. Results: Seventy-five patients had invasive cancer. Breast cancers were categorized into four tumor shapes: 34% of tumors were discoidal, 29% segmental, 19% spherical, and 18% irregular. If hypothetical spherical excisions were performed, non-spherical cases would excise 143% more tissue than the ideal resection volume. When the 3D shape of each tumor was provided to the surgeon during MR-guided BCS, the percentage of tissue overexcised in non-spherical cases was significantly less (143% vs. 66%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Information obtained from a supine MRI can be used to generate 3D tumor models and rapidly classify breast tumor shapes. The vast majority of invasive cancers and DCIS are not spherical. Knowledge of tumor shape may allow surgeons to excise breast cancer more precisely.',\n",
       "  '(0.565)  While changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumour DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumour. Matched tumour, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select epithelial cells from normal tissue, and neoplastic cells from tumour for genome-scale measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between contralateral-normal and tumour (63,271 CpG loci q <\\xa00.01), than between ipsilateral-normal and tumour (38,346 CpG loci q <\\xa00.01). We identified differential methylation in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p <\\xa00.01). In this comparison, hypomethylated loci were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3 and hypermethylated loci were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions. In addition, progression of shore hypermethylation was observed in tumours compared to matched ipsilateral normal tissue, and these alterations tracked to several well-established tumour suppressor genes. Our results indicate an epigenetic field effect in surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.

       "  '(0.563)  Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. Through an epigenome-wide association study we explored CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, RefFreeCellMix cell estimates, time of delivery, array chip and subject as random effect. We identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a subsequent breast cancer diagnosis (q-value <0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.'],\n",

Attentional processes are particularly affected in older adults with white matter hyperintensities (WMH), although specific neurovascular mechanisms have not been elucidated. We aimed to identify differences in attention-related neurofunctional activation and behavior between adults with and without WMH. Older adults with moderate to severe WMH (n = 18, mean age = 70 years), age-matched adults (n = 28, mean age = 72), and healthy younger adults (n = 19, mean age = 25) performed a modified flanker task during multi-echo blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Task-related activation was assessed using a weighted-echo approach. Healthy older adults had more widespread response and higher amplitude of activation compared to WMH adults in fronto-temporal and parietal cortices. Activation associated with processing speed was absent in the WMH group, suggesting attention-related activation deficits that may be a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease. WMH adults had greater executive contrast activation in the precuneous and posterior cingulate gyrus compared to HYA, despite no performance benefits, reinforcing the network dysfunction theory in WMH.',\n",

       "  '(0.505)  Individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can suffer from episodic memory impairments. Until now, the neural correlates underlying episodic retrieval in individuals with TBI remained scarce, particularly in older adults. We aimed to fill this gap by recording event-related potentials during an old/new episodic recognition task in 26 older adults, 13 healthy and 13 with TBI. The task manipulated the level of processing in encoding with the use of semantic organizational strategies (deep guided, deep self-guided, and shallow encoding). For all encoding conditions, behavioral data analyses on the discrimination rate indicated that older adults with TBI were globally impaired compared with healthy older adults. The electrophysiological results indicated that the left-parietal effect was larger in the deep guided condition than in the shallow condition. In addition, the results show that the mid-frontal and left-parietal positive old/new effects were absent in both groups. The main findings are the observation, in the control group only, of an early frontal old/new effect (P200; 150\\x96300 ms) and of a late frontal old/new effect on the left hemisphere, only in the Spontaneous condition. Together, results suggest an impairment of the allocation of attentional resources and working memory necessary for retrieving and monitoring items in the elderly with TBI.',\n",

Prescription of CGM was recorded for 54% of young adults; 66% were pump users, 46% on insulin injections and carbohydrate (carb) counting, and 32% on insulin doses without carb counting (P = 0.001). HbA1c was lower in young adults with CGM versus no CGM (7.7% ± 1.3% vs. 8.2% ± 1.7%, P = 0.001). Difference in HbA1c between CGM versus no CGM was greater in young adults noncarb counting (7.9% ± 1.4% vs. 8.9% ± 2.3%, P = 0.002) than carb counting (7.7% ± 1.5% vs. 8.2% ± 1.7%, P = 0.0008), or pump users (7.6 ± 1.2 vs. 7.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.01).

Methods Service managers of adult HAH services in the \\x80 Hospice UK' and National Association for Hospice at Home directories within England were invited to participate. Information on service configuration, referral, staffing, finance, care provision and enablers to service provision were collected by telephone interview. Results Of 128 services invited, 70 (54.7%) provided data. Great diversity was found. Most services operated in mixed urban/rural (74.3%) and mixed deprivation (77.1%) areas and provided hands-on care (97.1%), symptom assessment and management (91.4%), psychosocial support (94.3%) and respite care (74.3%). Rapid response (within 4 hours) was available in 65.7%; hands-on care 24 hours a day in 52.2%. Charity donations were the main source of funding for 71.2%. Key enablers for service provision included working with local services (eg, district nursing, general practitioner services), integrated health records, funding and anticipatory care planning.

Design: A cross-sectional study and cost analysis of all eConsult cases submitted between August 2014 and April 2016. Results: PCPs from Nunavut submitted 165 eConsult cases. The most popular specialties were dermatology (16%), cardiology (8%), endocrinology (7%), otolaryngology (7%), and obstetrics/gynaecology (7%). Specialists provided a response in a median of 0.9\\xa0days (IQR=0.3\\x963.0, range=0.01\\x9615.02). In 35% of cases, PCPs were able to avoid the face-to-face specialist visits they had originally planned for their patients. Total savings associated with eConsult in Nunavut are estimated at $180,552.73 or $1,100.93 per eConsult. Conclusions: The eConsult service provided patients in Nunavut\\x92s remote communities with prompt access to specialist advice. The service\\x92s chief advantage in Canada\\x92s northern communities is its ability to offer electronic access to a breadth of specialties far greater than could be supported locally.

       "  '(0.418)  Ensuring access to healthcare in emergency health situations is a persistent concern for health system planners. Emergency services, including critical care units for severe burns and coronary events, are amongst those for which travel time is the most crucial, potentially making a difference between life and death. Although it is generally assumed that access to healthcare is not an issue in densely populated urban areas due to short distances, we prove otherwise by applying improved methods of assessing accessibility to emergency services by the urban poor that take traffic variability into account. Combining unique data on emergency health service locations, traffic flow variability and informal settlements boundaries, we generated time-cost based service areas to assess the extent to which emergency health services are reachable by urban slum dwellers when realistic traffic conditions and their variability in time are considered. Variability in traffic congestion is found to have significant impact on the measurement of timely access to, and availability of, healthcare services for slum populations. While under moderate traffic conditions all slums in Dhaka City are within 60-minutes travel time from an emergency service, in congested traffic conditions only 63% of the city\\x92s slum population is within 60-minutes reach of most emergency services, and only 32% are within 60-minutes reach of a Burn Unit. Moreover, under congested traffic conditions only 12% of slums in Dhaka City Corporation comply with Bangladesh\\x92s policy guidelines that call for access to 1 health service per 50,000 population for most emergency service types, and not a single slum achieved this target for Burn Units. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) and First Aid & Casualty services provide the best coverage, with nearly 100% of the slum population having timely access within 60-minutes in any traffic condition. Ignoring variability in traffic conditions results in a 3-fold overestimation of geographic coverage and masks intra-urban inequities in accessibility to emergency care, by overestimating geographic accessibility in peripheral areas and underestimating the same for central city areas. The evidence provided can help policy makers and urban planners improve health service delivery for the urban poor. We recommend that taking traffic conditions be taken into account in future GIS-based analysis and planning for healthcare service accessibility in urban areas.',\n",

       "  '(0.402)  Background: Equitable access to primary health care (PHC) is an important component of integrated chronic disease management. Whilst context is known to influence access to PHC, it is poorly researched. The aim of this study was to determine the contextual influences associated with access arrangements in four Australian models of integrated PHC. Methods: A multi-method comparative case study design. Purposive sampling identified four models of PHC across six sites in two Australian states. Complexity theory informed the choice of contextual factors that influenced access arrangements, which were analysed across five dimensions: availability and accommodation, affordability, acceptability, appropriateness and approachability. Semi-structured interviews, document/website analysis and non-participant observation were used to collect data from clinicians, administrative staff and other key stakeholders. Within and cross-case thematic analysis identified interactions between context and access across sites. Results: Overall, financial viability, objectives of the PHC model and relationships with the local hospital network (LHN) underpinned access arrangements. Local supply of general practitioners and financial viability were strong influences on availability of after-hours services. Influences on affordability were difficult to determine because all models had nil/low out-of-pocket costs for general practitioner services. The biggest influence on acceptability was the goal/objectives of the PHC model. Appropriateness and to a lesser degree affordability arrangements were influenced by the relationship with the LHN. The provision of regular outreach services was strongly influenced by perceived population need, referral networks and model objectives. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for policy makers charged with improving access arrangements in PHC services. A financially sustainable service underpins attempts to improve access that meets the needs of the service population. Smaller services may lack infrastructure and capacity, suggesting there may be a minimum size for enhancing access. Access arrangements may be facilitated by aligning the objectives between PHC, LHN and other stakeholder models. While some access arrangements are relatively easy to modify, improving resource intensive (e.g. acceptability) access arrangements for vulnerable and/or chronic disease populations will require federal and state policy levers with input from primary health networks and LHNs.'],\n",

However, the extent of medical humanities teaching in medical schools is largely unknown. We reviewed medical school curricula in Canada, the UK and the US. We also explored the relationship between medical school ranking and the inclusion of medical humanities in the curricula. Methods: We searched the curriculum websites of all accredited medical schools in Canada, the UK and the US to check which medical humanities topics were taught, and whether they were mandatory or optional. We then noted rankings both by Times Higher Education and U.S. News and World Report and calculated the average rank. We formally explored whether there was an association between average medical school ranking and medical humanities offerings using Spearman's correlation and inverse variance weighting meta-analysis. Results: We identified 18 accredited medical school programmes in Canada, 41 in the UK, and 154 in the US. Of these, nine (56%) in Canada, 34 (73%) in the UK and 124 (80%) in the US offered at least one medical humanity that was not ethics. The most common medical humanities were medical humanities (unspecified), history, and literature (Canada); sociology and social medicine, medical humanities (unspecified), and art (UK); and medical humanities (unspecified), literature and history (US). Higher ranked medical schools appeared less likely to offer medical humanities. Conclusions: The extent and content of medical humanities offerings at accredited medical schools in Canada, the UK and the US varies, and there appears to be an inverse relationship between medical school quality and medical humanities offerings. Our analysis was limited by the data provided on the Universities' websites. Given the potential for medical humanities to improve medical education and medical practice, opportunities to reduce this variation should be exploited.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.856)  Medical educators and leaders have called for greater diversity among the physician workforce, including those with disabilities. However, many students with disabilities are precluded from entering and completing medical training due to historically restrictive technical standards and poor internal practices to protect student privacy. This limits the possibilities for growing this part of the workforce and making progress toward the ultimate goal of having a physician workforce that better represents the patients it serves. To achieve diversity among the physician workforce, medical education must create environments that allow students with disabilities to apply to, flourish in, and feel well supported in medical school. Recent additions to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements have helped to catalyze work in the area of disability inclusion by incorporating disability-focused mandates into graduate medical education accreditation standards. However, similar mandates for undergraduate medical education have not yet materialized. In this article, the authors call for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to elevate disability as a valued part of medical school diversity in its accreditation standards and to include protections for disabled students. The authors propose that the LCME can take 5 actions to promote institutional accountability toward students with disabilities: (1) define disability as diversity, (2) mandate disability support, (3) protect from conflicts of interest, (4) protect privacy, and (5) verify schools' technical standards comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. By adopting these recommendations, the LCME would send the powerful message that students with disabilities bring welcome expertise and value to the medical community.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.767)  Objective To explore medical students' views on and experiences of responding to out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Setting University College London (UCL). Participants 11 UCL Medical School students. Study design Qualitative. Methods and outcome measures We carried out 11 one-To-one semistructured interviews, with participant validation and reflective work. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Three core themes were identified. (1) 'We Did Debate a Bit: Should We Go? Should We Not?'-Students' decisions to respond were based on the appearance of the casualty; the presence and actions of bystanders; witnessing the incident; self-perceived competence, confidence and knowledge; and personal experiences and feelings associated with medical emergencies. (2) 'It Would Represent the Medical Profession Well if We Did Step In and Help'-Students felt that they had an ethical and/or professional duty to help. (3) 'No One Should Die Because of a Lack of.. Basic Life-Saving Techniques'-Students felt that medical school training alone had not sufficiently prepared them to respond to out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Improvements to training were suggested: integrating first aid/response training into the horizontal (systems-based) modules; teaching both common and less common medical emergencies and presentations; training that is led by experienced first responders and that increases students' exposure to out-of-hospital medical emergencies; and providing more revision training sessions. Conclusions Students felt that medical school training could be improved to better prepare them for responding to out-of-hospital medical emergencies, and wanted clarification on whether or not they have an ethical and/or professional duty to help. Further mixed-methods research using a larger sample needs to be carried out to confirm whether findings are transferable to other UK medical schools.\",\n",
       "  '(0.741)  Background: Intellectual curiosity can be defined as a desire for knowledge that leads to exploratory behavior and consists of an inherent and stable trait (i.e. trait curiosity) and a variable context-dependent state (i.e. state curiosity). Although intellectual curiosity has been considered an important aspect of medical education and practice, its relationship to medical education has not been empirically investigated. The purpose of this exploratory study was to describe medical students\\x92 intellectual curiosity across a four-year undergraduate program. Methods: We employed a cross-sectional design in which medical students, across a four-year undergraduate program at McGill University, completed the Melbourne Curiosity Inventory as a measure of their state and trait intellectual curiosity. A Mixed Models ANOVA was used to compare students across year of training. Results: Four hundred and two out of 751 students completed the inventory (53.5%). Trait curiosity was significantly higher than state curiosity (M = 64.5, SD = 8.5 versus M = 58.5, SD = 11.6) overall, and within each year of training. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe state and trait intellectual curiosity in undergraduate medical education. Findings suggest that medical students\\x92 state curiosity may not be optimally supported and highlight avenues for further research.',\n",
       "  \"(0.712)  Background: The ability to construct simple computer programs (coding) is being progressively recognized as a life skill. Coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. There is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world. Objective: The aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course? (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school? and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors? Methods: We developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. The course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. We explored in focus groups (FGs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Results: Our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. In addition, 6 major themes emerged from the FGs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students' skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design. Conclusions: Medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. They valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research. They considered that coding skills teaching should be offered as an optional part of the medical curriculum.\"],\n",
       " ['(0.683)  Background and objectives: HPV vaccination coverage is lower than that of other adolescent vaccines in the southern US. This study sought to characterize caregiver attitudes associated with adolescent HPV vaccination in the southern US and to inform interventions to promote HPV vaccination. Methods: From December 2019 \\x96 January 2020, caregivers of adolescents (ages 9\\x9617 years) living in thirteen southern US states were recruited from a nationally-representative online survey panel. Caregivers (N = 1,105) completed a cross-sectional survey that assessed general adolescent vaccine attitudes as well as those associated with the HPV vaccine and HPV vaccination decision-making. The primary study outcome was adolescents\\x92 receipt of at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. Results: Caregivers with vaccinated adolescents had greater positive attitudes towards adolescent vaccines compared to caregivers of unvaccinated adolescents. Top three areas of concern among caregivers were related to vaccine ingredients, perceptions that adolescents receive too many vaccines, and worry about vaccine side effects. In multivariable regression models, positive attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and HPV vaccination decision-making strongly associated with HPV vaccination in addition to general adolescent vaccination attitudes. Caregivers\\x92 reported discomfort with discussing the topic of sex was predictive of lower vaccination uptake for older adolescents. Conclusions: Public health messaging in the southern US should be tailored to reduce concerns about vaccine safety and to communicate the importance of timely HPV vaccination. Campaigns that deliver information specific to the HPV vaccine and to support vaccination decision-making may be more effective than those delivering only general adolescent vaccination information at promoting on-time HPV vaccination.',\n",
       "  \"(0.675)  Background: Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion regarding the benefits of receiving the current season's vaccine. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: current season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (dVE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241). Results: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (dVE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (dVE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (dVE = 7%; 95% CI - 7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the current season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (dVE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (dVE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (dVE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the current season only for H1N1 (dVE = 3%; 95% CI - 8%, 13%), but less protection against influenza H3N2 (dVE = - 20%; 95% CI - 36%, - 4%), and B (dVE = - 11%; 95% CI - 20%, - 2%). Conclusions: Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes, and for H1N1 and influenza B, vaccination in both seasons provides better VE than vaccination in the prior season only. Although VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only, it should be noted that past vaccination history cannot be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only. In addition, our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014-2015 influenza season and the impact of repeated vaccination for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season. It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail.\",\n",
       "  '(0.627)  Background: Many countries recommend influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Despite this recommendation, influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains under-utilized and uptake varies by country. Factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy may also vary across countries. Methods: As members of the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), five sites from four countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States) retrospectively identified cohorts of individuals aged 18\\x9650 years who were pregnant during pre-defined influenza seasons. Influenza vaccine coverage estimates were calculated for the 2010\\x9611 through 2015\\x9616 northern hemisphere and the 2012 through 2015 southern hemisphere influenza seasons, by site. Sites used electronic health records, administrative data, and immunization registries to collect information on pregnancy, health history, demographics, and vaccination status. Each season, vaccination coverage was calculated as the percentage of individuals who received influenza vaccine among the individuals in the cohort that season. Characteristics were compared between those vaccinated and unvaccinated, by site. Results: More than two million pregnancies were identified over the study period. Influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 5% to 58% across sites and seasons. Coverage increased consistently over the study period at three of the five sites (Western Australia, Alberta, and Israel), and was highest in all seasons at the United States study site (39\\x9658%). Associations with vaccination varied by country and across seasons; where available, parity >0, presence of a high-risk medical condition, and urban residence were consistently associated with increased likelihood of vaccination. Conclusions: Though increasing, uptake of influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains lower than recommended. Coverage varied substantially by country, suggesting an ongoing need for targeted strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake in this population.',\n",
       "  \"(0.627)  Objective: The purpose of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of male and female college students in Kentucky about HPV associated diseases and vaccines, and to determine which parameters predicted self-reported uptake of HPV vaccination. Materials and methods: A self-selected cross-sectional sample of college students completed an evidence-based online survey. Results: Of approximately 1200 potential respondents, 585 completed the survey. The average age was 20.6 (SD 3.15) and 78% were female; 84% of the population had had one or more sexual partners. Concern for HPV vaccine safety and potential need for boosters did not significantly deter vaccine uptake. Likewise, knowledge about HPV associated cancers was not predictive of vaccine uptake. On the other hand, parental influence for vaccination was a strong predictor for vaccine uptake (aOR = 5.32, 2.71\\x9613.03), and free vaccine nearly doubled the likelihood of being vaccinated (aOR 1.90, 1.05\\x963.41). In addition, the strong preference for the respondent's partner to be HPV vaccinated predicted vaccine uptake (aOR = 4.04, 95% CI: 2.31\\x967.05), but the lack of preference for partner vaccination predicted an unvaccinated self (aOR = 0.50, 0.27\\x960.93). Conclusions: HPV vaccination has been successful in young adult college students in Kentucky. Young adults prefer their partners to be HPV vaccinated regardless of whether they themselves are vaccinated. Parental influence and free vaccine were positive predictors for vaccine uptake in this population.\",\n",

We sought to describe HPV vaccine uptake among GBM and determine barriers and facilitators to vaccine initiation with a focus on healthcare access and utilization. Methods: Engage is a cohort study among GBM aged 16 + years in three Canadian cities recruited from 2017 to 2019 via respondent driven sampling (RDS). Men completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline. By publicly-funded vaccine eligibility (=26 years old = eligible for vaccination, =27 years old = ineligible), we described HPV vaccine uptake (initiation = 1 + dose, completion = 3 doses) and explored factors associated with vaccine initiation using Poisson regression. All analyses were weighted with the RDS-II Volz-Heckathorn estimator. Results: Across the three cities, 26\\x9635% and 14\\x9621% of men = 26 years and 7\\x9626% and 2\\x969% of men = 27 years initiated and completed HPV vaccination, respectively. Vaccine initiation was significantly associated with STI/HIV testing or visiting a HIV care specialist in the past six months (=26: prevalence ratio[PR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.06\\x964.36; =27: PR = 2.73, 95%CI 1.14\\x966.51) and past hepatitis A or B vaccination (=26: PR = 2.88, 95%CI 1.64\\x965.05; =27: PR = 2.03, 95%CI 1.07\\x963.86). Among men = 27 years old, vaccine initiation was also positively associated with accessing PrEP, living in Vancouver or Toronto, but negatively associated with identifying as Latin American and increasing age. Vaccine initiation was twice as likely among men = 27 years with private insurance versus no insurance. Conclusions: Sixty-five to 74% of men eligible for publicly-funded vaccine across the three cities remained unvaccinated against HPV by 2019. High vaccine cost may partly explain even lower uptake among men = 27 years old. Men seeking sexual health care were more likely to initiate vaccination; bundling vaccination with these services may help improve HPV vaccine uptake.\"]]"

Design: Mixed methods study. Setting: A core outcome set for pre-eclampsia was used as an exemplar. Sample: A long list of potential core outcomes was developed by undertaking a systematic review of pre-eclampsia trials and performing a thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews. Methods: Specific methods used to generate long lists of potential core outcomes were evaluated. Results: Different methodological decisions had a substantial impact on the identification of potential core outcomes. Extracting outcomes from published pre-eclampsia trials was an effective way of identifying 48 maternal, eight fetal, 25 neonatal outcomes, and eight patient-reported outcomes. Limiting the extraction of outcomes to primary outcomes or outcomes commonly reported in pre-eclampsia trials reduced the number and diversity of potential core outcomes identified. Thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews ensured an additional five patient reported outcomes and six outcomes related to future child health were identified. Conclusions: Future core outcome set developers should use quantitative and qualitative methods when developing a long list of potential core outcomes.

      "(0.627)  There is uncertainty about whether hypoxic injury accompanying donor death from ligature asphyxiation influences renal transplant outcomes, particularly for recipients of kidneys donated after circulatory death (DCD). The UK Registry analysis was undertaken to determine transplant outcomes in recipients of kidneys from donors who died following ligature asphyxiation. From 2003 to 2016, 2.7% (n = 521) of potential organ donors died following ligature asphyxiation (mostly suicide by hanging). Of these, 409 (78.5%) donated kidneys for transplantation (46.9% donation after brain death [DBD] and 53.1% DCD donors) resulting in 650 kidney transplants. Compared to other deceased donors, those dying from ligature asphyxiation were younger, more often male, and had less hypertension. Unadjusted patient and graft survival were superior for recipients of both DBD and DCD kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation, although after adjustment for donor/recipient variables, transplant outcomes were similar. A casecontrol matched analysis confirmed transplant outcomes for those who received kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation were similar to controls. Although caution is required in interpreting these findings because of potential selection bias, kidneys from donors dying of ligature asphyxiation suffer an additional warm ischemic insult that does not apparently adversely influence transplant outcomes, even for kidneys from DCD donors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.601)  High magnitudes and rates of loading have been implicated in the etiology of running-related injuries. Knowledge of kinematic variables that are predictive of kinetic outcomes could inform clinic-based gait retraining programs. Healthy novice female runners ran on a treadmill while 3-dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Kinetic outcomes consisted of vertical impact transient, average vertical loading rate, instantaneous vertical loading rate, and peak braking force. Kinematic outcomes included step length), hip flexion angle at initial contact, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass at initial contact, shank angle at initial contact, and foot strike angle. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the amount of variance in kinetic outcomes explained by kinematic outcomes. A moderate amount of variance in kinetic outcomes (vertical impact transient = 46%, average vertical loading rate = 37%, instantaneous vertical loading rate = 49%, peak braking force = 54%) was explained by several discrete kinematic variablespredominantly speed, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass, foot strike angle, and step length. Hip flexion angle and shank angle did not contribute to any models. Decreasing step length and transitioning from a rearfoot strike may reduce kinetic risk factors for running-related injuries. In contrast, clinical strategies such as modifying shank angle and hip flexion angle would not appear to contribute significantly to the variance of kinetic outcomes after accounting for other variables.\t\t\n",
      "(0.579)  Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) contributes to poor birth outcomes, in part through disrupted placental functions, which may be reflected in the placental epigenome. Here we present a meta-analysis of the associations between MSDP and placental DNA methylation (DNAm) and between DNAm and birth outcomes within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium (N = 1700, 344 with MSDP). We identify 443 CpGs that are associated with MSDP, of which 142 associated with birth outcomes, 40 associated with gene expression, and 13 CpGs are associated with all three. Only two CpGs have consistent associations from a prior meta-analysis of cord blood DNAm, demonstrating substantial tissue-specific responses to MSDP. The placental MSDP-associated CpGs are enriched for environmental response genes, growth-factor signaling, and inflammation, which play important roles in placental function. We demonstrate links between placental DNAm, MSDP and poor birth outcomes, which may better inform the mechanisms through which MSDP impacts placental function and fetal growth.\t\t\n",
      "(0.52)  Background: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program provides temporary relief from deportation and work permits for previously undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. DACA faced direct threats under the Trump administration. There is select evidence of the short-term impacts of DACA on population health, including on birth outcomes, but limited understanding of the long-term impacts. Methods: We evaluated the association between DACA program and birth outcomes using California birth certificate data (20092018) and a difference-in-differences approach to compare post-DACA birth outcomes for likely DACA-eligible mothers to birth outcomes for demographically similar DACA-ineligible mothers. We also separately compared birth outcomes by DACA eligibility status in the first 3 years after DACA passage (20122015) and in the subsequent 3 years (20152018) - a period characterized by direct threats to the DACA program - as compared to outcomes in the years prior to DACA passage. Results: In the 7 years after its passage, DACA was associated with a lower risk of small-for-gestational age (- 0.018, 95% CI: - 0.035, - 0.002) and greater birthweight (45.8 g, 95% CI: 11.9, 79.7) for births to Mexican-origin individuals that were billed to Medicaid. Estimates were consistent but of smaller magnitude for other subgroups. Associations between DACA and birth outcomes were attenuated to the null in the period that began with the announcement of the Trump U.S. Presidential campaign (2015-2018), although confidence intervals overlapped with estimates from the immediate post-DACA period. Conclusions: These findings suggest weak to modest initial benefits of DACA for select birthweight outcomes during the period immediately following DACA passage for Mexican-born individuals whose births were billed to Medicaid; any benefits were subsequently attenuated to the null. The benefits of DACA for population health may not have been sufficient to counteract the impacts of threats to the program's future and heightened immigration enforcement occurring in parallel over time. \n",

Setting/Participants Top box office hits released in the USA primarily between 1988 and 2011 (n=2134). Intervention The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), implemented in 1998. Main outcome measures This study analyses trends for whether or not movies depicted smoking, and among movies with smoking, counts for character smoking scenes and average smoking scene duration. Results There was no detectable trend for any measure prior to the MSA. In 1999, 79% of movies contained smoking, and movies with smoking contained 8 scenes of character smoking, with the average duration of a character smoking scene being 81 s. After the MSA, there were significant negative post-MSA changes (p<0.05) for linear trends in proportion of movies with any smoking (which declined to 41% by 2011) and, in movies with smoking, counts of character smoking scenes (which declined to 4 by 2011). Between 1999 and 2000, there was an immediate and dramatic drop in average length of a character smoking scene, which decreased to 19 s, and remained there for the duration of the study. The probability that the drop of -62.5 (95% CI -55.1 to -70.0) seconds was due to chance was p<10-16. Conclusions This studys correlational data suggest that restricting payments for tobacco product placement coincided with profound changes in the duration of smoking depictions in movies.\t\t\n",

We conduct a discrete choice experiment to investigate how adult tobacco cigarette smokers' demand for e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes varies by four attributes: (1) whether e-cigarettes are considered healthier than tobacco cigarettes, (2) the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation device, (3) bans on use in public places, and (4) price. We find that adult smokers' demand for e-cigarettes is motivated more by health concerns than by the desire to avoid smoking bans or higher prices. (JEL C35, I12, I18).\t\t\n",
      "(0.748)  Introduction: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. There are efficacious behavioral and pharmacological options for smoking cessation including three FDA approved therapiesnicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion. Nevertheless, uptake of smoking cessation treatments continues to be poor and there is a need for novel smoking cessation treatments. Areas covered: This article reviews the biobehavioral basis of nicotine addiction, its implications for smoking cessation treatments, the various neurotransmitter systems involved in nicotine addictive effects, and their potential therapeutic value. Included are discussions around the role of genetic factors in predicting response to pharmacotherapy and what we know about appropriate application of pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for tobacco use disorder. The evidence for harm reduction measures in individuals who are not willing or able to quit smoking is also reviewed. Expert commentary: Many neurotransmitter system targets have been investigated as a result of our understanding of the underlying neurobiology of tobacco use disorder, and there remain important targets that have yet to be fully explored. rTMS or combination therapies are proposed as possible novel strategies to improve smoking cessation.\t\t\n",
      "(0.736)  Introduction: There is an absence of evidence regarding the impact of treating tobacco smoking and vaping equivalently in workplace policies. We aimed to describe and compare smoking and vaping policies in acute nonspecialist NHS Trusts (n = 131) and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (n = 131) in England. Methods: We conducted a census of smoking and vaping policies through organizational websites searches and direct requests for information. We recorded whether and where smoking and vaping were permitted. Results: Smoking was prohibited indoors in all organizations. No NHS Trust permitted smoking freely outdoors, in contrast with 60% of HEIs. In 27% of NHS Trusts and 33% of HEIs smoking was permitted in designated areas, while in 73% of NHS Trusts and 8% of HEIs smoking was prohibited anywhere on site. Vaping was prohibited indoors in all NHS Trusts and all but one HEI, but permitted freely outdoors in 18% of NHS Trusts and 75% of HEIs. Vaping was permitted in designated outdoor spaces in 23% of NHS Trusts: 21% had areas shared with smokers; 2% had separate vaping areas. Vaping was permitted in designated outdoor areas in 18% of HEIs, all of which were shared with smokers. Vaping was prohibited anywhere on site in 54% of NHS Trusts and 6% of HEIs. Conclusions: Policies vary considerably in whether vaping and smoking are treated equivalently. Smoking policies in most HEIs should be reviewed to include more effective tobacco control approaches. Evidence is needed on the impact of imposing shared or separate spaces on vapers and smokers. Implications: This report provides a comprehensive review of smoking and vaping policies in two types of organization across England. It highlights key discrepancies between current public health recommendations for vaping and existing workplace policies, which often lead to smokers and vapers sharing spaces. The report identifies the need for evidence on the impact of imposing shared spaces on smokers and vapers to inform workplace policies that maximize public health benefit.\t\t\n",

The sample included 2502 never smokers (average age at entry<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.5<U+2009>years), 1700 (67.9%) of whom completed follow-up surveys 17 months later. Exposure to the top 100 highest-grossing films for each year between 2009 and 2013 was assessed by content-coding films for tobacco and then by asking adolescents whether they had seen each of 50 titles, randomly selected from the larger pool, then parsing exposure into tertiles. Logistic regression models estimated aOR for the following transitions: nonsusceptible to susceptible never smoker, never smoker to ever smoker, and never smoker to current smoking (last 30 days). Results At follow-up, 34.4% of nonsusceptible never smokers became susceptible, 24.1% reported having tried smoking, and 9.4% were current smokers. Most exposure to movie smoking was from US-produced films (average 60.3 minutes compared with only 3.4 minutes from Argentine films). Greater exposure to smoking in movies was significantly associated with increased odds of becoming susceptible (aORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.77, 95% CI 1.30-2.41), of trying smoking (aORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.54, 1.14-2.08), and marginally associated with current smoking (AORfirst vs third tertile<U+2009>1.54, 0.99-2.40). Exposure to smoking in US- or Argentine-produced films had similar associations. Conclusion In Argentina, exposure to smoking in the movies predicted future smoking transitions among early adolescents, with most exposure coming from viewing US movies. \n",

      "(0.655)  Background: Feasibility studies are often conducted before committing to a randomised controlled trial (RCT), yet there is little published evidence to inform how useful feasibility studies are, especially in terms of adding or reducing waste in research. This study attempted to examine how many feasibility studies demonstrated that the full trial was feasible and whether some feasibility studies were inherently likely to be feasible or not feasible, based on the topic area and/or research setting. Methods: Keyword searches were conducted on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry to identify all completed feasibility studies which had been conducted in the UK. Results: A total of 625 records from the 1933 identified were reviewed before it became evident that it would be futile to continue. Of 329 feasibility studies identified, 160 had a known outcome (49%), 133 (83%) trials were deemed to be feasible and only 27 (17%) were reported to be non-feasible. There were therefore too few studies to allow the intended comparison of differences in non-feasible studies by topic and/or setting. Conclusions: There were too few studies reported as non-feasible to draw any useful conclusions on whether topic and/or setting had an effect. However, the high feasibility rate (83%) may suggest that non-feasible studies are subject to publication bias or that many feasible studies are redundant and may be adding waste to the research pathway.\t\t\n",
      "(0.61)  Background: The Health Economics Research Centre (HERC) Database of Mapping Studies was established in 2013, based on a systematic review of studies developing mapping algorithms predicting EQ-5D. The Mapping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards (MAPS) statement was published in 2015 to improve reporting of mapping studies. We aimed to update the systematic review and assess the extent to which recently-published studies mapping condition-specific quality of life or clinical measures to the EQ-5D follow the guidelines published in the MAPS Reporting Statement. Methods: A published systematic review was updated using the original inclusion criteria to include studies published by December 2016. We included studies reporting novel algorithms mapping from any clinical measure or patient-reported quality of life measure to either the EQ-5D-3L or EQ-5D-5L. Titles and abstracts of all identified studies and the full text of papers published in 2016 were assessed against the MAPS checklist. Results: The systematic review identified 144 mapping studies reporting 190 algorithms mapping from 110 different source instruments to EQ-5D. Of the 17 studies published in 2016, nine (53%) had titles that followed the MAPS statement guidance, although only two (12%) had abstracts that fully addressed all MAPS items. When the full text of these papers was assessed against the complete MAPS checklist, only two studies (12%) were found to fulfil or partly fulfil all criteria. Of the 141 papers (across all years) that included abstracts, the items on the MAPS statement checklist that were fulfilled by the largest number of studies comprised having a structured abstract (95%) and describing target instruments (91%) and source instruments (88%). Conclusions: The number of published mapping studies continues to increase. Our updated database provides a convenient way to identify mapping studies for use in cost-utility analysis. Most recent studies do not fully address all items on the MAPS checklist.\t\t\n",
      "(0.572)  Mixed studies reviews include empirical studies with diverse designs (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods). To make the process of identifying relevant empirical studies for such reviews more efficient, we developed a mixed filter that included different keywords and subject headings for quantitative (e.g., cohort study), qualitative (e.g., focus group), and mixed methods studies. It was tested for six journals from three disciplines. We measured precision (proportion of retrieved documents being relevant), sensitivity (proportion of relevant documents retrieved), and specificity (proportion of non-relevant documents not retrieved). Records were coded before applying the filter and compared with retrieved records, and descriptive statistics were performed, suggesting the mixed filter has high sensitivity, but lower precision and specificity (close to 50%). Next, based on the success of the filter, we developed an automated text classification system that can automatically select empirical studies in order to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews. Several algorithms were trained and validated with 8,050 database records that were previously manually categorized. Decision trees had the best results and surpassed the accuracy of the filter by 30% when using full-text documents. This algorithm was then adapted into an online format that can be used by researchers to analyze their bibliography and categorize records into 'empirical' and 'nonempirical'.\t\t\n",
      "(0.544)  This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the associations between obesity and puberty timing based on scientific evidence. Eight electronic databases were searched up to February 2017 for eligible studies, and two reviewers screened the articles and extracted the data independently. A total of 11 cohort studies with 4841 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared with the group of normal-weight girls, the obese group had more girls with menarche (RR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.59-2.19, 2 studies). The number of girls with early puberty was significantly higher in the obese group than the normal weight group (RR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.32-4.52, 5 studies). However, no differences were detected between girls who were obese or normal weight at age of menarche (WMD: -0.53 years, 95% CI: -1.24-0.19, 2 studies). There is no consistent result in the relationship between obesity and timing of pubertal onset in boys. Obesity may contribute to early onset of puberty in girls, while in boys, there is insufficient data. Given the limited number of cohort studies included in this meta-analysis, high-quality studies with strong markers of puberty onset, as well as standardized criteria for defining obesity are needed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.535)  Rationale for the review: Air travel may be associated with viruses spread via infected passengers and potentially through in-flight transmission. Given the novelty of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on transmission dynamics of other respiratory viruses. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft, report policy implications and to highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention. Methods: We searched four electronic databases (1 February 2020-27 January 2021) and included studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings. Key findings: We included 18 studies on in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission (130 unique flights) and 2 studies on wastewater from aircraft. The quality of evidence from most published studies was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive samples with high cycle threshold values (33-39). Index case definition was heterogeneous across studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68 to 100%. Authors traced 2800/19 729 passengers, 140/180 crew members and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. Three studies, each investigating one flight, reported no secondary cases. Secondary attack rate among studies following up >80% of passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0 and 8.2%. The studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Two studies performed viral cultures with 10 positive results. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of likelihood and extent. The variation in design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting future studies of transmission on aircraft should be developed. \n",

      "(0.519)  We aimed to compare 30-day readmission after medical-surgical hospitalization for people who experience imprisonment and matched people in the general population in Ontario, Canada. We used linked population-based correctional and health administrative data. Of people released from Ontario prisons in 2010, we identified those with at least one medical or surgical hospitalization between 2005 and 2015 while they were in prison or within 6 months after release. For those with multiple eligible hospitalizations, we randomly selected one hospitalization. We stratified people by whether they were in prison or recently released from prison at the time of hospital discharge. We matched each person with a person in the general population based on age, sex, hospitalization case mix group, and hospital discharge year. Our primary outcome was 30-day hospital readmission. We included 262 hospitalizations for people in prison and 1,268 hospitalizations for people recently released from prison. Readmission rates were 7.7% (95%CI 4.4-10.9) for people in prison and 6.9% (95% CI 5.5-8.3) for people recently released from prison. Compared with matched people in the general population, the unadjusted HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.41-1.27) for people in prison and 0.78 (95%CI 0.60-1.02) for people recently released from prison. Adjusted for baseline morbidity and social status, hospitalization characteristics, and post-discharge health care use, the HR for 30-day readmission was 0.74 (95%CI 0.40-1.37) for people in prison and 0.48 (95%CI 0.36-0.63) for people recently released from prison. In conclusion, people recently released from prison had relatively low rates of readmission. Research is needed to elucidate reasons for lower readmission to ensure care quality and access.\t\t\n",
      "(0.511)  We are a team of academic researchers, people with learning disabilities and carers. We worked together to design training materials for people with learning disabilities and carers to work as co-researchers on research projects. The training was for doing a type of research called ethnography. When you do ethnography, you spend time with people to learn about their lives. In this article, we describe what we did and what we learnt. We think more people with learning disabilities and carers should be involved in research but many do not have the confidence to do it. Training can help with that. We also think that ethnography is a type of research that can be easier to do than other types of research. This is because ethnography uses the skills lots of us already have the following: watching, listening and talking to people. Abstract: Background: There is a strong ethical case and an urgent need for more participatory research practices in disability research but a lack of resources to support this. It is important to involve people with learning disabilities and carers at all stages, including when designing training for co-research. Methods: We co-developed training materials to support people with learning disabilities and carers to work as ethnographic co-researchers and for academic researchers to facilitate co-research. We focused on what people with learning disabilities and carers thought was important to learn. Findings: Whilst not all types of research methods are easy to democratise, ethnographic observation is a research method that lends itself well to participatory co-research. Conclusions: For people to be able to meaningfully participate, research processes need to become more accessible and transparent. Training that considers the needs and priorities of people with learning disabilities and carers and addresses the confidence gap is key for meaningful co-research.\t\t\n",
      "(0.478)  Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) has become increasingly prevalent worldwide, this study investigated the associations of SUD and alcohol, cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use disorder with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 11 major CVD subtypes. Methods: This study was based on a 20% random sample of residents in British Columbia, Canada, who were aged 18 <U+02D7> 80 years at baseline on January 1, 2015. Using linked administrative health data during 2010 <U+02D7> 2014, we identified people with various SUDs and prevalent CVDs at baseline, and examined the cross-sectional associations between SUDs and CVDs. After excluding people with CVDs at baseline, we followed the cohort for 4 years to identify people who developed incident CVDs, and examined the longitudinal associations between SUDs and CVDs. Results: The cross-sectional analysis at baseline included 778,771 people (mean age 45 years, 50% male), 13,279 (1.7%) had SUD, and 41,573 (5.3%) had prevalent CVD. After adjusting for covariates, people with SUD were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 <U+02D7> 2.8) times more likely than people without SUD to have prevalent CVD. The longitudinal analysis included 617,863 people, 17,360 (2.8%) developed incident CVD during the follow-up period. After adjusting for covariates, people with SUD were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6 <U+02D7> 1.9) times more likely than people without SUD to develop incident CVD. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were more pronounced for people with opioid or stimulant use disorder. Conclusions: People with SUD are more likely to have prevalent CVD and develop incident CVD compared with people without SUD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.473)  Purpose: This study aims to describe knowledge of Canadas Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act (GSDOA) and take home naloxone (THN) training and kit possession among people being released from provincial correctional facilities in British Columbia. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted surveys with clients of the Unlocking the Gates Peer Health Mentoring program on their release. The authors compared the characteristics of people who had and had not heard of the GSDOA and who were in possession of a THN kit. Findings: In this study, 71% people had heard of the GSDOA, and 55.6% were in possession of a THN kit. This study found that 99% of people who had heard of the GSDOA indicated that they would call 911 if they saw an overdose. Among people who perceived themselves to be at risk of overdose, 28.3% did not have a THN kit. Only half (52%) of participants had a mobile phone, but 100% of those with a phone said they would call 911 if they witnessed an overdose. Originality/value: The authors found that people with knowledge of the GSDOA were likely to report that they would call 911 for help with an overdose. Education about the GSDOA should be a standard component of naloxone training in correctional facilities. More than one in four people at risk of overdose were released without a naloxone kit, highlighting opportunities for training and distribution. Access to a cellphone is important in enabling calls to 911 and should be included in discharge planning.\t\t\n",
      "(0.455)  Regulations regarding bathroom use by transgender people affect youth across the United States. This study examines youth opinions on bathroom use regulations. Data were obtained from MyVoice, a weekly text messaging survey of youth aged 1424 years. Youth were recruited nationally at community events and online; Southeast Michigan was overrepresented. Mixed methods analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology. The majority of respondents (n = 683) were white (71.4%) and had education beyond high school (56.5%). Most (79%) stated that bathroom use by transgender people should not be restricted, rationalizing: 1) bathroom use is private and should be a personal decision; 2) choosing bathrooms is a matter of equality, freedom, and human rights; 3) transgender people are not sexual perpetrators; and 4) forcing transgender people to use particular bathrooms puts them at risk. Contrary to the current policy in many schools, respondents do not support restrictions on bathroom use by transgender people. \n",

      "(0.602)  By mid-2019 there were more than 80 AI ethics guides available in the public domain. Despite this, 2020 saw numerous news stories break related to ethically questionable uses of AI. In part, this is because AI ethics theory remains highly abstract, and of limited practical applicability to those actually responsible for designing algorithms and AI systems. Our previous research sought to start closing this gap between the what and the how of AI ethics through the creation of a searchable typology of tools and methods designed to translate between the five most common AI ethics principles and implementable design practices. Whilst a useful starting point, that research rested on the assumption that all AI practitioners are aware of the ethical implications of AI, understand their importance, and are actively seeking to respond to them. In reality, it is unclear whether this is the case. It is this limitation that we seek to overcome here by conducting a mixed-methods qualitative analysis to answer the following four questions: what do AI practitioners understand about the need to translate ethical principles into practice? What motivates AI practitioners to embed ethical principles into design practices? What barriers do AI practitioners face when attempting to translate ethical principles into practice? And finally, what assistance do AI practitioners want and need when translating ethical principles into practice?\t\t\n",
      "(0.599)  Background: Hospital medicine has grown as a field. However, no study has examined trends in career choices by internists over the past decade. Objective: To measure changes in practice setting for general internists. Design: Using Medicare fee-for-service claims (2008 to 2018) and data from the American Board of Internal Medicine, practice setting types were measured annually for general internists initially certifying between 1990 and 2017. Setting: General internists (non-subspecializing) treating Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Patients: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with at least 20 evaluation and management (E&M) visits annually. Measurements: Practice setting types were defined as hospitalist (>95% inpatient E&M), outpatient only (100% outpatient E&M), or mixed. Results: 67 902 general internists, comprising 80% of all general internists initially certified from 1990 to 2017 (n= 84 581), were studied. From 2008 to 2018, both hospitalists and outpatientonly physicians increased as percentages of general internists (25% to 40% and 23% to 38%, respectively). This was accompanied by a 56% decline in the percentage of mixed-practice physicians (52% to 23%) as these physicians largely migrated to outpatient-only practice. By 2018, 71% of newly certified general internists practiced as hospitalists compared with only 8% practicing as outpatient-only physicians. Most (86% of hospitalists in 2013) had the same practice type 5 years later. This retention rate was similar across early career and more senior physicians (86% and 85% for the 1999 and 2012 initial certification cohorts, respectively) and for the outpatient-only practice type (95%) but was only 57% for the mixed practice type. Limitation: Practice setting measurement relied only on 7Medicare fee-for-service claims. Conclusion: Newly certified general internists are largely choosing hospital medicine as their career choice whereas more senior physicians increasingly see patients only in the outpatient setting.\t\t\n",
      "(0.546)  Background: Return-of-service (ROS) agreements require international medical graduates (IMGs) who accept medical residency positions in Canada to practice in specified geographic areas following completion of training. However, few studies have examined how ROS agreements influence career decisions. We examined IMG resident and early-career family physicians perceptions of the residency matching process, ROS requirements, and how these factors shaped their early career decisions. Methods: As part of a larger project, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with early-career family physicians and family medicine residents in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia. We asked participants about their actual or intended practice characteristics (e.g., payment model, practice location) and factors shaping actual or intended practice (e.g., personal/professional influences, training experiences, policy environments). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis approach was employed to identify recurring patterns and themes. Results: For this study, we examined interview data from nine residents and 15 early-career physicians with ROS agreements. We identified three themes: IMGs strategically chose family medicine to increase the likelihood of obtaining a residency position; ROS agreements limited career choices; and ROS agreements delayed preferred practice choice (e.g., scope of practice and location) of an IMGs early-career practice. Conclusions: The obligatory nature of ROS agreements influences IMG early-career choices, as they necessitate strategically tailoring practice intentions towards available residency positions. Existing analyses of IMGs early-career practice choices neglect to distinguish between ROS and practice choices made independently of ROS requirements. Further research is needed to understand how ROS influences longer term practice patterns of IMGs in Canada.\t\t\n",
      "(0.542)  BACKGROUND: The province of British Columbia is facing a family physician shortage despite consistent increases in the number of physicians per capita and ongoing reforms to address the shortage. We identify physicians' priorities for structural reform, describe the alignment of those priorities with BC's suite of reforms and compare responses between established physicians and those new to practice; we also assessed rates of burnout. METHODS: All family physicians credentialed within Vancouver Coastal Health in 2018 were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Respondents were asked about their practice model and characteristics, demographics, level of burnout and reform priorities. We used <U+03C7>2 tests and multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations between personal and practice characteristics, burnout and reform priorities. RESULTS: Of the 1017 family physicians invited to participate, 525 (51.6%) responded. Of these, 399 (76.0%) indicated a need for fundamental change to how primary care is delivered; 244 (46.4%) would prefer to be a clinic employee rather than a small business owner. Other reform priorities included options to practise in a team (stated as very important by 69.6% of respondents), direct funding for team roles (66.7%), direct clinic funding (59.8%), part-time work options (64.7%), and ability to take planned vacations and parental leave (81.1%). The importance of individual reform priorities varied based on the participants' model of practice, location and years in practice. Of respondents, 108 (21.1%) had experienced a high level of burnout. INTERPRETATION: Almost half of family physicians would prefer to be employees rather than small business owners and over 20% reported a high level of burnout. Practice models offering direct employment model have very limited availability and are not included in the current suite of reforms in BC, potentially pulling physicians away from community-based family medicine and into other models or specialties.\t\t\n",
      "(0.54)  Background Focused practice within family medicine may be increasing globally, but there is limited research on the factors contributing to decisions to focus practice. Aim To examine the factors influencing resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice across three Canadian provinces. Design and setting A subset of qualitative interview data were analysed from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, Canada. Method Included in the analysis were a total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practise in a focused area. Comparisons were made for participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice, while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice. Results Three key themes were identified of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current structure of the healthcare system; support from colleagues; and training experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included: alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice. Conclusion Both groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the healthcare system. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces. More research is needed to understand the implications of resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice within the physician workforce. \n",

Methods: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of articles published from 01/01/2000 to 01/07/2017. Results: We included 23 studies. Immediately after provision of risk information 87% of individuals were able to recall the absolute risk estimate. Less than half believed that to be their risk, with up to 71% believing their risk to be higher than the estimate. Provision of risk information increased accuracy of perceived absolute risk immediately after risk information compared with no information (pooled RR 4.16 (95%CI 1.2813.49), 3 studies). There was no significant effect on comparative risk accuracy (pooled RR 1.39 (0.722.69), 2 studies) and either no change or a reduction in cancer worry, anxiety and fear. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complex cognitive processes involved in the conceptualisation of risk. Practice implications: Individuals who appear to understand and are able to recall risk information most likely do not believe it reflects their own risk.\t\t\n",
      "(0.556)  Background: Prevention and early detection of depression is a top public health priority. Accurate perception of depression risk may play an important role in health behavior change and prevention of depression. However, the way in which people in the community perceive their risk of developing depression is currently unknown. Methods: We analyzed the baseline data from a randomized controlled trial in 358 men and 356 women who are at high risk of having a major depressive episode (MDE). The predicted risk was assessed by sex-specific multivariable risk predictive algorithms for MDE. We compared participants perceived risk and their predicted risk. Accurate risk perception was defined as perceived risk is in the range of predicted risk ± 10%. Results: In men, 29.7% perceived their risk accurately; 47.5% overestimated their risk; 22.8% underestimated their risk. In women, the proportions were 21.7%, 59.6% and 18.7%, respectively. Compared to men, women were more likely to overestimate their risk and less likely to be accurate. Regression modeling revealed that poor self-rated health and higher predicted depression risk were associated with inaccuracy of risk perception in men; a family history of MDE, higher psychological distress and lower predicted risk were associated with inaccuracy of risk perception in women. Conclusions: Individuals who are at high risk of developing depression tend to overestimate their risk, especially women. Inaccurate depression risk perception is related to people's health status. Educational interventions are needed to enhance the accuracy of risk perception to encourage positive behavior change and uptake of preventive strategies.\t\t\n",
      "(0.545)  Alzheimers disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality in the elderly. While the coding change of APOE-e4 is a key risk factor for late-onset AD and has been believed to be the only risk factor in the APOE locus, it does not fully explain the risk effect conferred by the locus. Here, we report the identification of AD causal variants in PVRL2 and APOC1 regions in proximity to APOE and define common risk haplotypes independent of APOE-e4 coding change. These risk haplotypes are associated with changes of AD-related endophenotypes including cognitive performance, and altered expression of APOE and its nearby genes in the human brain and blood. High-throughput genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis further supports the roles of these risk haplotypes in modulating chromatin states and gene expression in the brain. Our findings provide compelling evidence for additional risk factors in the APOE locus that contribute to AD pathogenesis.\t\t\n",
      "(0.54)  Objective To identify the proportion of individuals with an accurate perception of their risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) prior to, immediately after and eight weeks after receiving a personalised risk estimate. Additionally, we aimed to explore what factors are associated with underestimation and overestimation immediately post-intervention. Methods Cohort study based on the data collected in the Diabetes Risk Communication Trial. We included 379 participants (mean age 48.9 (SD 7.4) years; 55.1% women) who received a genotypic or phenotypic risk estimate for T2D. Results While only 1.3% of participants perceived their risk accurately at baseline, this increased to 24.7% immediately after receiving a risk estimate and then dropped to 7.3% at eight weeks. Those who overestimated their risk at baseline continued to overestimate it, whereas those who underestimated their risk at baseline improved their risk accuracy. We did not identify any other characteristics associated with underestimation or overestimation immediately after receiving a risk estimate. Conclusion Understanding a received risk estimate is challenging for most participants with many continuing to have inaccurate risk perception after receiving the estimate. Practice implications Individuals who overestimate or underestimate their T2D risk before receiving risk information might require different approaches for altering their risk perception.\t\t\n",
      "(0.53)  ObjectiveTo determine risk factors for multiple sclerosis (MS) in immigrants and to compare MS risk in immigrants and long-term residents in Ontario, Canada.MethodsWe applied a validated algorithm to linked, population-based immigration and health claims data to identify incident cases of MS in immigrants and long-term residents between 1994 and 2016. We conducted 2 multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses: 1 analysis limited to the immigrant cohort assessing potential risk factors for developing MS, and 1 analysis comparing MS risk between immigrants and matched long-term residents (1:3 match).ResultsWe identified 2,304,302 immigrants for the immigrant-only analysis, of whom 1,526 (0.066%) developed MS. Risk was greatest in those <15 years old at landing (referent <15 years; 16-30 years: hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.85; 31-45 years: HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.47-0.64). Immigrants from the Middle East (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.40) were at greater MS risk than immigrants from Western nations; all other regions had lower risk (p < 0.0001). The matched analysis included 2,207,751 immigrants and 6,362,169 long-term residents. Immigrants were less likely to develop MS than long-term residents (p < 0.0001), although this lower risk was attenuated with longer residence in Canada.ConclusionsMS incidence in immigrants to Ontario, Canada, varied widely by region of origin, with greatest risk seen in those from the Middle East. Longer residence in Canada was associated with increased risk, even with migration in adulthood, suggesting that environmental exposures into adulthood contribute to MS risk. \n",

MHT and masked uncontrolled hypertension were defined using office BP and awake BP alone and awake, asleep, or 24-h BP. LVH was assessed by echocardiography.Results:Among participants without high office BP not taking antihypertensive medication, the prevalence of MHT defined by the JNC7 guideline and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline was 25.0 and 33.5% using awake BP only and 37.1 and 52.0% when using awake, asleep, or 24-h BP. The adjusted prevalence ratios for LVH associated with MHT versus sustained normotension defined by the JNC7 and 2017 ACC/AHA BP guidelines were 1.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-2.64] and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.97-2.51), respectively, when using awake BP only and 2.16 (95% CI: 1.36-3.44) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.58-1.82), respectively, when using awake, asleep or 24-h BP. There was no evidence that masked uncontrolled hypertension was associated with LVH when defined using the BP thresholds in either the JNC7 or the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.Conclusion:The association of MHT with LVH may depend on the BP thresholds used.\t\t\n",
      "(0.68)  The 2011 NICE hypertension guideline (CG127) undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure (BP) assessment methods to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. The guideline also undertook a costutility analysis exploring the cost-effectiveness of the monitoring methods. A new systematic review was undertaken as part of the 2019 NICE hypertension guideline update (NG136). BP monitoring methods compared included Ambulatory BP, Clinic BP and Home BP. Ambulatory BP was the reference standard. The economic model from the 2011 guideline was updated with this new accuracy data. Home BP was more sensitive and specific than Clinic BP. Specificity improved more than sensitivity since the 2011 review. A higher specificity translates into fewer people requiring unnecessary treatment. A key interest was to compare Home BP and Ambulatory BP, and whether any improvement in Home BP accuracy would change the model results. Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in all age and sex subgroups. In all subgroups, Ambulatory BP was associated with lower costs than Clinic BP and Home BP. In all except one subgroup (females aged 40), Ambulatory BP was dominant. However, Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in 40-year-old females as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Home BP versus Ambulatory BP was above the NICE £20,000 threshold. The new systematic review showed that the accuracy of both Clinic BP and Home BP has increased. However, Ambulatory BP remains the most cost-effective option to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension in all subgroups evaluated.\t\t\n",
      "(0.647)  The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk. In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents. Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements.\t\t\n",
      "(0.637)  Most guidelines have recommended lower home blood pressure (BP) threshold when clinic BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg is used for diagnosis of hypertension. However, home BP thresholds to define hypertension have never been determined in the general population in the United States. We identified home BP thresholds for stage 1 (BP =130/80 mm Hg) hypertension using a regression-based approach in the DHS (Dallas Heart Study; n=5768) and the NCMH study (North Carolina Masked Hypertension; n=420). Home BP thresholds were also assessed using outcome-derived approach based on the composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in the DHS cohort. For this approach, BP thresholds were identified only for systolic BP because diastolic BP was not associated with the outcome. Among untreated participants, the regression-derived thresholds for home BP corresponding to clinic BP for stage 1 hypertension were 129/80 mm Hg in blacks, 130/80 mm Hg in whites, and 126/78 mm Hg in Hispanics, respectively. The results are similar in the North Carolina cohort. The 11-year composite cardiovascular and mortality events corresponding to clinic systolic BP >130 mm Hg were higher in blacks than in whites and Hispanics (13.3% versus 5.98% versus 5.52%, respectively). Using a race/ethnicity-specific composite outcome in the untreated DHS participants, the outcome-derived home systolic BP thresholds corresponding to stage 1 hypertension were 130 mm Hg in blacks, 129 mm Hg in whites, and 131 mm Hg in Hispanics, respectively. Our data based on both regression-derived and outcome approach support home BP threshold of 130/80 mmHg for diagnosis of hypertension in blacks, whites, and Hispanics.\t\t\n",
      "(0.595)  The Lancet Commission on Hypertension identified that a key action to address the worldwide burden of high blood pressure (BP) was to improve the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy. Currently, there are over 3000 commercially available BP devices, but many do not have published data on accuracy testing according to established scientific standards. This problem is enabled through weak or absent regulations that allow clearance of devices for commercial use without formal validation. In addition, new BP technologies have emerged (e.g. cuffless sensors) for which there is no scientific consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards. Altogether, these issues contribute to the widespread availability of clinic and home BP devices with limited or uncertain accuracy, leading to inappropriate hypertension diagnosis, management and drug treatment on a global scale. The most significant problems relating to the accuracy of BP devices can be resolved by the regulatory requirement for mandatory independent validation of BP devices according to the universally-accepted International Organisation for Standardization Standard. This is a primary recommendation for which there is an urgent international need. Other key recommendations are development of validation standards specifically for new BP technologies and online lists of accurate devices that are accessible to consumers and health professionals. Recommendations are aligned with WHO policies on medical devices and universal healthcare. Adherence to recommendations would increase the global availability of accurate BP devices and result in better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, thus decreasing the worldwide burden from high BP. \n",

      "(0.568)  BACKGROUND Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the cornerstone of multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. DMT treatment is a preference-sensitive decision in which shared decision making is indicated. METHODS We used qualitative methods to explore usability of MS decision aids in people aged 18 to 70 years diagnosed with MS. Semistructured interviews aimed to assess patients' overall reaction to using the decision aids. This included specific aspects of the user experience to improve readability, format, content, and patient opinions about whether the integration of the decision aids into visits with MS clinicians would be feasible and assist with making better DMT selections. RESULTS Twenty-three interviews were completed with eligible patients with MS aged 18 to 70 years to improve readability. Using thematic analysis, 5 themes emerged from the analysis including decision aids are easy and understandable, include cost, prioritize side effects and tests, increase font size, and have a simpler injectable grid. We also identified areas for improvement including formatting, side effects of DMT options, transparency of data sources, research, and development. CONCLUSION Overall findings suggest that the decision aids are usable, easy to understand, and helpful to facilitate shared decision making for DMT selection. This work will help guide further modifications to the prototype MS decision aids before publication and can inform the growing body of knowledge regarding the development of high-quality decision aids.\t\t\n",
      "(0.543)  Background Upon admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), all patients should discuss their goals of care and express their wishes concerning life-sustaining interventions (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)). Without such discussions, interventions that prolong life at the cost of decreasing its quality may be used without appropriate guidance from patients. Objectives To adapt an existing decision aid about CPR to create a wiki-based decision aid individually adapted to each patients risk factors; and to document the use of a wiki platform for this purpose. Methods We conducted three weeks of ethnographic observation in our ICU to observe intensivists and patients discussing goals of care and to identify their needs regarding decision making. We interviewed intensivists individually. Then we conducted three rounds of rapid prototyping involving 15 patients and 11 health professionals. We recorded and analyzed all discussions, interviews and comments, and collected sociodemographic data. Using a wiki, a website that allows multiple users to contribute or edit content, we adapted the decision aid accordingly and added the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) prediction rule calculator. Results We added discussion of invasive mechanical ventilation. The final decision aid comprises values clarification, risks and benefits of CPR and invasive mechanical ventilation, statistics about CPR, and a synthesis section. We added the GO-FAR prediction calculator as an online adjunct to the decision aid. Although three rounds of rapid prototyping simplified the information in the decision aid, 60% (n = 3/5) of the patients involved in the last cycle still did not understand its purpose. Conclusions Wikis and user-centered design can be used to adapt decision aids to users needs and local contexts. Our wiki platform allows other centers to adapt our tools, reducing duplication and accelerating scale-up. Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of care and in using the decision aid. A video version of the decision aid could clarify its purpose.\t\t\n",
      "(0.534)  Background Little is known about the decision-making experiences of seniors and informal caregivers facing decisions about seniors housing decisions when objective decision making measures are used. Objectives To report on seniors and caregivers experiences of housing decisions. Design A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach supplemented by qualitative data. Setting Sixteen health jurisdictions providing home care services, Quebec province, Canada. Participants Two separate samples of seniors aged 65 years and informal caregivers of cognitively impaired seniors who had made a decision about housing. Measurements Information on preferred choice and actual choice about housing, role assumed in the decision, decisional conflict and decision regret was obtained through closed-ended questionnaires. Research assistants paraphrased participants narratives about their decision-making experiences and made other observations in standardized logbooks. Results Thirty-one seniors (median age: 85.5 years) and 48 caregivers (median age: 65.1 years) were recruited. Both seniors and caregivers preferred that the senior stay at home (64.5% and 71.7% respectively). Staying home was the actual choice for only 32.2% of participating seniors and 36.2% of the seniors cared for by the participating caregivers. Overall, 93% seniors and 71% caregivers reported taking an active or collaborative role in the decision-making process. The median decisional conflict score was 23/100 for seniors and 30/100 for caregivers. The median decision regret score was the same for both (10/100). Qualitative analysis revealed that the housing decision was influenced by factors such as seniors health and safety concerns and caregivers burden of care. Some caregivers felt sad and guilty when the decision did not match the seniors preference. Conclusion The actual housing decision made for seniors frequently did not match their preferred housing option. Advanced care planning regarding housing and better decision support are needed for these difficult decisions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.523)  Shared decision making is recommended as a strategy to help patients identify what matters most to them and make informed decisions about musculoskeletal care. In part 5 of the Overcoming Overuse series, we look at the evidence supporting shared decision making as a strategy to help curb overuse. Using shared decision making in clinical consultations may help to reduce the overuse of options that are not beneficial and to increase use of care supported by evidence. Shared decision making could support clinicians in promoting uptake of active rehabilitation options with a favorable balance of benefits to harms. Shared decision making facilitates conversations about unnecessary tests or treatments and could be a key strategy for overcoming overuse.\t\t\n",
      "(0.512)  Background: Decision aids are patient-focused tools that have the potential to reduce the overuse of head computed tomography (CT) scans. Objective: The objective of this study was to create a consensus among Canadian mild traumatic brain injury and emergency medicine experts on modifications required to adapt two American decision aids about head CT use for adult and paediatric mild traumatic brain injury to the Canadian context. Methods: We invited 21 Canadian stakeholders and the two authors of the American decision aids to a Nominal Group Technique consensus meeting to generate suggestions for adapting the decision aids. This method encourages idea generation and sharing between team members. Each idea was discussed and then prioritised using a voting system. We collected data using videotaping, writing material and online collaborative writing tools. The modifications proposed were analysed using a qualitative thematic content analysis. Results: Twenty-one participants took part in the meeting, including researchers and clinician researchers (n = 9; 43%), patient partners (n = 3; 14%) and decision makers (n = 2; 10%). A total of 84 ideas were generated. Participants highlighted the need to clarify the purpose of the decision aids, the nature of the problem being addressed and the target population. The tools require sociocultural adaptations, better identification of their target population, better description of head CT utility, advantages and related risks, modification of the visual and written representation of the risk of brain injury and head CT use, and locally adapted, patient follow-up plans. Conclusions: This study based on a Nominal Group Technique identified several adaptations for two American decision aids about head CT use for mild traumatic brain injury to support their use in Canadas different healthcare, social, cultural and legal context. These adaptations concerned the target users of the decision aids, the information presented, and how the benefits and risks were communicated in the decision aids. Future steps include prototyping the two adapted decision aids, conducting formative evaluations with actual emergency department patients and clinicians, and measuring the impact of the adapted tools on CT scan use. \n",

Websites of IMC members were searched for the names of the patient groups receiving donations, value of the donations and year the donations were made. The website of each patient group that was listed as receiving a donation was then searched for information about the name of companies making donations along with the value of the donations, year the donations were made and percent of the patient groups income represented by the donation. For donations over $50 000, an attempt was made to match donations that companies made to donations that patient groups received. Eleven of 44 IMC members reported making 165 donations to 114 different patient groups. Seventy-nine of these 114 groups reported receiving 373 donations from IMC members. Information about the value of donations, the year that they were given and received and the percent of patient groups income that they represented was limited. Donations made and received could not be matched because of the absence of information about the donations. Reporting on websites about donations by both companies and patient groups in Canada is haphazard, inconsistent and incomplete. Reforms are need to both the way that companies and patient groups report donations.\t\t\n",

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Canadian national patient groups. Participants Ninety-seven patient groups with publicly available websites. Interventions Each patient group was contacted by email. Information from patient groups' websites was collected about: total annual revenue for the latest fiscal year, year revenue was reported, revenue from pharmaceutical company donors, purpose of the donation, presence of donors' logos on the website and hyperlinks to donors' websites, previous and current employment information about board members and staff, external audits about the group's finances and whether the group endorses products made by donors. Analysis of publicly available policies looking at: board and/or advisory board, acceptance of donations and revenue generation, independence of decision-making, endorsements, assistance to and/or interactions between patient members from a donor or another company/person acting on behalf of a donor and audits/monitoring/compliance. Primary and secondary outcome measures Number of patient groups posting information on their websites about their relationships with pharmaceutical companies; the presence and contents of patient group policies covering different topics about relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Results Fifty-three (54.6%) of 97 groups reported donations from pharmaceutical companies. Forty-one (42.3%) groups showed the logos of pharmaceutical companies on their websites and 22 (53.7%) had hyperlinks to pharmaceutical company websites. Twenty-five (25.8%) of these groups endorsed pharmaceutical products produced by brand-name companies that had donated to the groups. Twenty-six (26.8%) groups had policies that dealt with relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Conclusions Pharmaceutical industry funding of the included patient groups was common. Despite this, relatively little information was provided on patient group websites about their relationships with pharmaceutical companies. Only 26 out of 97 groups had publicly available policies that directly dealt with their relationships with pharmaceutical companies.\t\t\n",
      "(0.553)  Background Patient groups represent the interest of their members when it comes to drug funding. Many patient groups receive grants from pharmaceutical companies that make products being considered for funding. This research examines whether there is an association between the positions that Canadian groups take about the products and conflicts of interest with the companies. Methods The Common Drug Review (CDR) and panCanadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) make recommendations to Canadian provincial and federal drug plans about funding particular drug-indications. Both utilize input from patient groups in making their recommendations. Patient group submissions are available from both organizations and these submissions contain statements about conflicts of interest. Views of the patient groups, with and without a conflict with the company making the drug under consideration and without any conflicts at all, were assessed and then compared with the recommendations from CDR and pCODR. Results There was a total of 222 reports for drug-indications. There were 372 submissions from 93 different patient groups. Groups declared a total of 1896 conflicts with drug companies in 324 (87.1%) individual submissions. There were 268 submissions where groups declared a conflict with the company making the product or said they had no conflict. Irrespective of whether there was a conflict, the views of patient groups about the drug-indications under consideration were the same. There was no statistically significant difference between views of patient groups and the recommendations from CDR and/or pCODR. Conclusions The large majority of patient groups making submissions about funding of particular drug-indications had conflicts with the companies making the products and their views about the products were almost always positive. This association between funding and views needs to be further investigated to determine if a true cause and effect exists.\t\t\n",
      "(0.488)  Introduction: Emerging policy consensus advocates that patient-centered care should include an active, practice-level patient role, but it is unknown how commonly these roles are implemented. We sought to understand current prevalence and predictors of practice-level patient engagement in US primary care settings. Methods: We assessed practice-level patient engagement by using 2016 American Board of Family Medicine Certification Examination registration data, restricted to ambulatory primary care site respondents randomly selected for a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) question module. Multivariate logistic regression models identified predictors of high-intensity patient engagement, defined as a patient advisory council or patient volunteers in quality improvement activities. Results: A total of 6900 examinees reported practicing in primary care sites; 1368 randomly received PCMH questions. Practice-level patient engagement included patient surveys (76.5%; 95% CI, 74.378.8%), patient suggestion boxes (52.9%; 95% CI, 50.255.5%), patient board of director memberships (18.8%; 95% CI, 16.720.9%), patient advisory councils (23.8%; 95% CI, 21.526.0%), and patient participation in quality improvement (20.5%; 95% CI, 18.322.6%). High-intensity patient engagement was reported by 31.1% (95% CI, 28.733.6%); predictors included large practice size (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.96 5.57), serving more vulnerable patient populations, (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.18 2.84) and PCMH certification (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.622.97). Conclusions: Nearly one-third of physicians reported working in settings with high-intensity practice-level patient engagement. An implementation science approach should examine why high-intensity activities are more common in some practice settings and whether these activities add value through improved patient experience and health outcomes.\t\t\n",
      "(0.487)  Purpose: Studies demonstrate how patient roles in system redesign teams reflect a continuum of involvement and influence. This research shows the process by which patients move through this continuum and effectively engage within redesign projects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors studied members of redesign teams, consisting of 510 members: clinicians, systems engineers, health system staff and patient(s), from three health systems working on separate projects in a patient safety learning lab. Weekly team meetings were observed, January 2016April 2018, 17 semi-structured interviews were conducted and findings through a patient focus group were refined. Grounded theory was used to analyze field notes and transcripts. Findings: Results show how the social identity process enables patients to move through stages in a patient engagement continuum (informant, partner and active change agent). Initially, patient and team member perceptions of the patient's role influence their respective behaviors (activating, directing, framing and sharing). Subsequently, patient and team member behaviors influence patient contributions on the team, which can redefine patient and team member perceptions of the patient's role. Originality/value: As health systems grow increasingly complex and become more interested in responding to patient expectations, understanding how to effectively engage patients on redesign teams gains importance. This research investigates how and why patient engagement on redesign teams changes over time and what makes different types of patient roles valuable for team objectives. Findings have implications for how redesign teams can better prepare, anticipate and support the changing role of engaged patients. \n",

      "(0.607)  Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.\t\t\n",
      "(0.521)  Introduction: Biologics are currently protected from competition by eight years of data protection. The renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) increases data protection from 8 to 10 years. This study investigates the effect of such an extension on drug spending in Canada. Methods: A list of currently available biologics eligible for data protection along with their 2017 sales was compiled. Two years were added to the current expiration date of data protection to see if it exceeded patent protection, and any theoretical change in spending due to delayed competition was calculated. The number of biologics approved after January 1, 1995, that have competition and the time until competition started was analyzed. Theoretical competition due to increased data protection for biologics where data protection has already expired was examined. Results: Depending on how much of the market is captured by biologic competitors and how strong the patents are, lost savings from data protection extension could range from $0 to $305.8 million. One biologic competitor currently on the market could theoretically have been affected by an increase in data protection. Increased data protection would have had minor effects on products that have already lost data protection. Discussion: The potential impact on drug expenditures of a two-year extension in data protection is highly variable. Possible increases in spending on biologics strengthen the rationale for a national pharmacare plan where monopsony buying power would help to control drug prices overall and offset increased spending on biologics.\t\t\n",

The aim of this package is to enable the rapid assessment of routine data for use in cost-effectiveness analyses. By quantifying the comparability of routine data with gold-standard trial data, we inform decisions on the suitability of routine data for cost-effectiveness analysis.

      "(0.487)  The use of deep learning is becoming increasingly important in the analysis of medical data such as pattern recognition for classification. The use of primary healthcare computational medical records (CMR) data is vital in prediction of infection prevalence across a population, and decision making at a national scale. To date, the application of machine learning algorithms to CMR data remains under-utilized despite the potential impact for use in diagnostics or prevention of epidemics such as outbreaks of influenza. A particular challenge in epidemiology is how to differentiate incident cases from those that are follow-ups for the same condition. Furthermore, the CMR data are typically heterogeneous, noisy, high dimensional and incomplete, making automated analysis difficult. We introduce a methodology for converting heterogeneous data such that it is compatible with a deep autoencoder for reduction of CMR data. This approach provides a tool for real time visualization of these high dimensional data, revealing previously unknown dependencies and clusters. Our unsupervised nonlinear reduction method can be used to identify the features driving the formation of these clusters that can aid decision making in healthcare applications. The results in this work demonstrate that our methods can cluster more than 97.84% of the data (clusters >5 points) each of which is uniquely described by three attributes in the data: Clinical System (CMR system), Read Code (as recorded) and Read Term (standardized coding). Further, we propose the use of Shannon Entropy as a means to analyse the dispersion of clusters and the contribution from the underlying attributes to gain further insight from the data. Our results demonstrate that Shannon Entropy is a useful metric for analysing both the low dimensional clusters of CMR data, and also the features in the original heterogeneous data. Finally, we find that the entropy of the low dimensional clusters are directly representative of the entropy of the input data (Pearson Correlation = 0.99, R2 = 0.98) and therefore the reduced data from the deep autoencoder is reflective of the original CMR data variability.\t\t\n",
      "(0.435)  In this perspective we want to highlight the rise of what we call \"digital phenotyping\"or inferring insights about peopleãs health and behavior from their digital devices and data, and the challenges this introduces. Indeed, the collection, processing, and storage of data comes with significant ethical, security and data governance considerations. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the importance of scientific data and modeling, both to understand the nature and spread of the disease, and to develop treatment. But digital devices have also played a (controversial) role, with track and trace systems and increasingly \"vaccine passports\"being rolled out to help societies open back up. These systems epitomize a wider and longer-standing trend towards seeing almost any form of personal data as potentially health data, especially with the rise of consumer health trackers and other gadgets. Here, we offer an overview of the risks this introduces, drawing on the earlier revolution in genomic sequencing, and propose guidelines to help protect privacy whilst utilizing personal data to help get society back up to speed. \n",

Action Area One of the Framework, Making Health a Shared Value, highlights the role of individual and community factors in achieving a societal commitment to health and health equity, centered around three drivers: Mindset and Expectations, Sense of Community, and Civic Engagement. To stimulate research about how Action Area One and its drivers may impact health, Evidence for Action (E4A), a signature research funding program of RWJF, developed and released a national Call for Proposals (CFP). The process of formulating the CFP and reviewing proposals surfaced important challenges for research on creating and sustaining shared values to foster and maintain a Culture of Health. In this essay, we describe these considerations and provide examples from funded projects regarding how challenges can be addressed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.449)  People working on behalf of population health, community health, or public health often experience confusion or ambiguity in the meaning of these and other common termsthe similarities and differences and how they bear on the tasks and division of labor for care delivery and public health. Shared language must be clear enough to help, not hinder people working together as they ultimately come to mutual understanding of roles, responsibilities, and actions in their joint work. Based on an iterative lexicon development process, the authors developed and propose a definitional framework as an aid to navigating among related population and community health terms. These terms are defined, similarities and differences clarified, and then organized into 3 categories that reflect goals, realities, and ways to get the job done. Goals include (a) health as well-being for persons, (b) population health as that goal expressed in measurable terms for groups, and (c) community health as population health for particular communities of interest, geography, or other defining characteristicgroups with shared identity and particular systemic influences on health. Realities are social determinants as influences, health disparities as effects, and health equity as both a goal and a design prin-ciple. Ways to get the job done include health care delivery systems for enrollees and public health in population-based civic activitieswith a broad zone of collaboration where streams of effort converge in partnership with served communities. This map of terms can enable people to move forward together in a broad zone of collaboration for health with less confusion, ambiguity, and conflict.\t\t\n",
      "(0.446)  The pursuit of health equity and social justice lie at the heart of community-empowered health promotion practice. However, there is a need to address the colonial legacy and its contributions to health inequities. The process of decolonization is essential to eliminating the mechanisms that contributed to such inequities. To this end, we propose an Applied Decolonial Framework for Health Promotion that integrates decolonial processes into health promotion practice. We present characteristics of the framework, its values for health promotion transformations and considerations for using the framework in health promotion practice. The framework will help health promotion stakeholders attend to colonizing structures within the field and engage with communities to achieve social justice and health equity.\t\t\n",
      "(0.444)  The World Health Organization and other institutions are considering Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a technology that can potentially address some health system gaps, especially the reduction of global health inequalities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, because most AI-based health applications are developed and implemented in high-income countries, their use in LMICs contexts is recent and there is a lack of robust local evaluations to guide decision-making in low-resource settings. After discussing the potential benefits as well as the risks and challenges raised by AI-based health care, we propose five building blocks to guide the development and implementation of more responsible, sustainable, and inclusive AI health care technologies in LMICs.\t\t\n",
      "(0.434)  Background: We analyze the University of British Columbia's Department of Political Science's first course on health, 'Global Politics and Health,' to determine whether one course could inform political science students to tackle health issues. The major concept was global public health is politics writ large, as determinants of health are rooted in economic and social power. Course objectives encouraged student agency in ameliorating population health status. Methods: We use three surveys, with qualitative and quantitative components, to assess interest and knowledge of public health issues, and determine whether student agency increased as the course progressed. Results: We confirmed that political science develops an excellent foundation for the analysis of issues related to global public health status. One course can stimulate curiosity in health issues. Unexpectedly, we discovered that students' greatest learning outcome integrated personal, interpersonal, and scholarly analyses of health issues. This provided an avenue for students outside of the health sciences to frame mental health, sexuality, and other stigmatized subjects within scholarly discourse. After the course, virtually all students had developed a sense of agency, hope, and tools to understand the roots of mental and physical health. Following case studies on various countries, students quickly grasped the significant impact of politics and economics on people's health. Discussion: We recommend that political science departments offer courses that focus on health for all alongside existing courses on healthcare systems' politics. Furthermore, departments of public health may benefit from including political science courses as core elements of their curriculum to assist graduates in navigating the highly politicized infrastructure of public health. Both disciplines stand to gain from this interdisciplinary opportunity-in the service of better health for all. \n",

Additionally, particular first-line targeted therapies have shown survival improvements in selected populations. Optimal first-line and maintenance therapies remain unclear. Here, currently available evidence was synthesized to elucidate optimal first-line and maintenance therapy within patient groups. Literature was searched for randomized trials evaluating first-line and maintenance regimens in advanced NSCLC patients. Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed within molecularly and clinically selected groups. The primary outcome was combined clinically meaningful OS and PFS benefits. A total of 87 records on 56 trials evaluating first-line treatments with maintenance were included. Results showed combined clinically meaningful OS and PFS benefits with particular first-line with maintenance treatments, (1) first-line intercalated chemotherapy+erlotinib, maintenance erlotinib in patients with EGFR mutations, (2) first-line afatinib, maintenance afatinib in patients with EGFR deletion 19, (3) first-line chemotherapy + bevacizumab, maintenance bevacizumab in EGFR wild-type patients, (4) chemotherapy+conatumumab, maintenance conatumumab in patients with squamous histology, (5) chemotherapy+cetuximab, maintenance cetuximab or chemotherapy + necitumumab, maintenance necitumumab in EGFR FISH-positive patients with squamous histology, and (6) first-line chemotherapy+bevacizumab, maintenance bevacizumab or first-line sequential chemotherapy+gefitinib, maintenance gefitinib in patients clinically enriched for EGFR mutations with nonsquamous histology. No treatment showed combined clinically meaningful OS and PFS benefits in patients with EGFR L858R or nonsquamous histology. Particular first-line with maintenance treatments show meaningful OS and PFS benefits in patients selected by EGFR mutation or histology. Further research is needed to achieve effective therapy for patients with EGFR mutation L858R or nonsquamous histology.\t\t\n",
      "(0.369)  Purpose: Evidence suggests anti-estrogen endocrine therapy (ET) is associated with adverse cognitive effects; however, findings are based on small samples and vary in the cognitive abilities affected. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. Methods: Electronic databases were searched in November 2016. Fourteen studies totaling 911 BC patients on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or tamoxifen (TAM) and 911 controls (i.e., non-cancer controls and BC controls not using ET) were included. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into six domains. Effect sizes were computed to compare (1) ET patients versus controls and (2) TAM patients versus AI patients. Results: In cross-sectional comparisons, ET patients performed worse than control groups on verbal learning/memory, visual learning/memory, frontal executive function, and processing speed, but did not differ on psychomotor efficiency or visuospatial function. Subgroup analyses revealed that verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls. In other domains, ET patients and BC controls performed equivalently. Regarding change from pre-treatment performance, ET patients did not differ from controls on any domain. TAM and AI patients did not from one another differ overall; however, subgroup analyses indicated that TAM patients performed better than non-steroidal AI patients on several domains, but showed few performance differences relative to steroidal AI patients. Conclusions: Verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls, suggesting specific adverse effects on this domain. Additional studies assessing change from pre-treatment performance and differences between steroidal and non-steroidal AIs are warranted.\t\t\n",
      "(0.367)  Despite widespread acknowledgement of internet use for information about health, patients report not disclosing use of online health information in consultations. This paper compares patients' reported use of the internet with matched video recordings of consultations. The concepts of doctorability and epistemics are employed to consider similarities and differences between patients reports in interviews and actions in the consultation. Data are drawn from the Harnessing Resources from the Internet study conducted in the UK. The data set consists of 281 video-recorded general practice consultations, with pre-consultation questionnaires completed by all patients, interviews with all 10 participating doctors and 28 selected patients. We focus on the 28 patient interviews and associated consultation recordings. A conversation analytic (CA) approach is used to systematically inspect both the interview and consultation data. In interviews patients presented use of the internet as associated with appropriate self-management and help-seeking. In consultations patients skilfully translated what they had found on the internet in order to provide grounds for the actions they sought. We conclude that patients translate and utilise what they have found on the internet to assert the doctorability of their presenting problems. Furthermore, patients design their talk in both interviews and consultations to accord with their understanding of the epistemic rights of both doctors and patients. Patients search the internet so they are informed about their medical problem, however they carefully manage disclosure of information to avoid disrupting the smooth running of medical interactions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.355)  Background There is little data describing the differences in epinephrine (epi) administration and cardiac complications among older and younger patients with anaphylaxis. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two urban emergency departments (ED) over a 5 year-period, and included adults who met a pre-specified criteria for anaphylaxis. Patients =50 years of age were defined as older. Univariate logistic regression was performed to compare the difference in frequency of epi administration between the older and younger groups. Among those who received epi, the proportion of patients who received doses exceeding the recommended maximum and who had pre-specified cardiovascular complications were compared between the two groups, stratified further by route of administration. Results Of 2995 allergy-related visits, 492 met criteria for anaphylaxis, including 122 (24.8%) older patients. Older patients were less likely to receive epi injection (36.1% vs. 60.5%). Of those who received epi, older patients were more likely to receive excessive dose of epi (7/44, 15.9% vs 2/225, 0.9%, unadjusted OR 20.7, 95% CI 3.8211.7). Four (4/44, 9.1%) older patients experienced cardiovascular complications, compared to 1/225 (0.4%) in the younger group (unadjusted OR 22.4, 95% CI 2.11129.8). When examining only intra-muscular epinephrine, 1/31 older patients had cardiac complications, compared to 1/186 in the younger group. Conclusion Older patients with anaphylaxis were less likely to receive epi injection. Intramuscular epi appears safe in this population; however, the use of intravenous epi should be avoided in older patients due to the potential of developing serious cardiac complications.\t\t\n",

The objective of this study is to evaluate an interprofessional SH deprescribing program within a community team-based, primary care practice, with or without cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Methods: Retrospective chart review for patients referred to the team pharmacist for SH deprescribing from February 2016 to June 2019. Results: A total of 121 patients were referred for SH deprescribing, with 111 (92%) patients who attempted deprescribing (average age 69, range 29-97 years) and 22 patients who also received CBT-I. Overall, 36 patients (32%) achieved complete abstinence, and another 36 patients (32%) reduced their dosage by =50%. For the 36 patients who achieved complete abstinence, 26 (72%) patients remained abstinent at 6 months (9 patients resumed using SH and 1 patient was lost to follow-up). The proportion of patients achieving complete abstinence or reduced dosage of =50% (successful tapering) was higher with CBT-I than without CBT-I but did not reach statistical significance (77% vs 62%, p = 0.22). There were also no statistically significant differences detected in the success between those who took a benzodiazepine and those who took a Z-drug (67% vs 61%, p = 0.55) or for those who took SH daily and those who took them intermittently (67% vs 44%, p = 0.09). Conclusion: Almost two-thirds of patients participating in our pharmacist-led program were able to stop or taper their SH medications by =50%. The role of CBT-I in SH deprescribing remains to be further elucidated. Can Pharm J (Ott) 2021;154:xx-xx. \n",

The past 40 years have been marked by considerable development of methodologies and methods in literature reviews. This paper aims to provide a brief historical overview of systematic reviews which will help to have a better understanding of what, why, when, and how they were developed. The paper is structured in three parts. The first part will provide a definition of systematic reviews and their main characteristics. The second part will present three main periods of the evolution of systematic reviews: foundation period (1970-1989), institutionalization period (1990-2000), and diversification period (2001-). These periods can be distinguished by the users of scientific evidence, the methodological influence, and the technological development.

      "(0.583)  Cochrane devolves most editorial governance of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), including title prioritization, protocol registration, peer-review, editorial oversight and subsequent review deposition, to specific Cochrane Review Group (CRG) editorial boards. Current Cochrane policy stipulates authors of reviews who are also members of the supporting CRG declare this non-financial conflict of interest and confirm no involvement in the review editorial process. The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to assess adherence to Cochrane's editorial conflict of interest policy. All 260 published Cochrane reviews (CR) in issues 1 to 6 from 2019 of the CDSR were reviewed. A total of 133 (51.2%, 133/260) of CRs had at least one author that was also listed as an editor in the CRG. Of these, only five (3.8%, 5/133) appropriately declared the conflict according to Cochrane policy. In 6.5% (17/133) CRs, the contact author had a leading editorial position within the CRG and in only four of 17 was this declared according to Cochrane policy. No CR with the contact author who also had a leading editorial position described methods to prevent any potential issues related to this scenario during the editorial process in accordance with Cochrane policy. We propose a specific form to improve the transparency and reliability of editorial conflict of interest reporting in CRs. The suggested form can be adapted to other contexts.\t\t\n",
      "(0.578)  Background: In 2018, a so-called crisis developed in the international network of systematic reviewers known as Cochrane. It was widely depicted in terms of two competing narrativesbad behaviour by one member of Cochrane's Governing Board and scientific and moral decline within Cochrane. Objective: Our goal was to distil insights on the structural issues underpinning the crisis, without taking a definitive position on the accuracy of either narrative. Approach and dataset: In this paper, we draw on (among other theories) Becker's notion of moral entrepreneurship and Foucault's conceptualisation of power to analyse the claims and counterclaims made by different parties. Our dataset consisted of publicly available materials (blogs, journal articles, newspaper articles) to end 2018, notably those relating to the expulsion of one Governing Board member. Main findings: Both narratives include strong moral claims about the science of systematic review and the governance of scientific organizations. The expelled individual and his supporters defined good systematic reviews in terms of a particular kind of methodological rigour and elimination of bias, and good governance largely in terms of measures to achieve independence from industry influence. Most of Cochrane's Governing Board and their sympathizers evaluated systematic reviews according to a broader range of criteria, incorporating factors such as attention to relationships among reviewers and reflexivity and dialogue around scientific and other judgements. They viewed governance partly in terms of accountability to an external advisory group. Power-knowledge alignments in Cochrane have emerged from, and contributed to, a particular system of meaning which is now undergoing evolution and challenge. Conclusion: Polarizing Cochrane's crisis into two narratives, only one of which is true, is less fruitful than viewing it in terms of a duality consisting of tensions between the two positions, each of which has some validity. Having framed the conflict as primarily philosophical and political rather than methodological and procedural, we suggest how Cochrane and its supporters and critics might harness their tensions productively.\t\t\n",
      "(0.572)  New approaches to evidence synthesis, which use human effort and machine automation in mutually reinforcing ways, can enhance the feasibility and sustainability of living systematic reviews. Human effort is a scarce and valuable resource, required when automation is impossible or undesirable, and includes contributions from online communities (crowds) as well as more conventional contributions from review authors and information specialists. Automation can assist with some systematic review tasks, including searching, eligibility assessment, identification and retrieval of full-text reports, extraction of data, and risk of bias assessment. Workflows can be developed in which human effort and machine automation can each enable the other to operate in more effective and efficient ways, offering substantial enhancement to the productivity of systematic reviews. This paper describes and discusses the potentialand limitationsof new ways of undertaking specific tasks in living systematic reviews, identifying areas where these human/machine technologies are already in use, and where further research and development is needed. While the context is living systematic reviews, many of these enabling technologies apply equally to standard approaches to systematic reviewing. \n",

      "(0.552)  OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to describe the incidence of diabetes following pancreatic disease, assess how these patients are classified by clinicians, and compare clinical characteristics with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Primary care records in England (n = 2,360,631) were searched for incident cases of adult-onset diabetes between 1 January 2005 and 31 March 2016. We examined demographics, diabetes classification, glycemic control, and insulin use in those with and without pancreatic disease (subcategorized into acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatic disease) before diabetes diagnosis. Regression analysis was used to control for baseline potential risk factors for poor glycemic control (HbA1c =7% [53 mmol/mol]) and insulin requirement. RESULTS We identified 31,789 new diagnoses of adult-onset diabetes. Diabetes following pancreatic disease (2.59 [95%CI 2.38-2.81] per 100,000 person-years) wasmore common than type 1 diabetes (1.64 [1.47-1.82]; P < 0.001). The 559 cases of diabetes following pancreatic diseaseweremostly classified by clinicians as type 2 diabetes (87.8%) and uncommonly as diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (2.7%). Diabetes following pancreatic disease was diagnosed at a median age of 59 years and BMI of 29.2 kg/m2. Diabetes following pancreatic disease was associated with poor glycemic control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [1.3-2.2]; P < 0.001) compared with type 2 diabetes. Insulin use within 5 years was 4.1% (3.8-4.4) with type 2 diabetes, 20.9% (14.6-28.9) with diabetes following acute pancreatitis, and 45.8% (34.2-57.9) with diabetes following chronic pancreatic disease. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas is frequently labeled type 2 diabetes but hasworse glycemic control and a markedly greater requirement for insulin.\t\t\n",
      "(0.548)  Aim: The purpose of the study was to analyse self-descriptions of diabetes burnout in individuals with Type 1 diabetes via YouTube videos. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study, a systematic approach was used to search YouTube videos with a title, description or content specifically about diabetes burnout dated between 2007 and 2017. Irrelevant or duplicated videos were excluded using eligibility criteria. All videos meeting inclusion criteria (n = 32) from individuals with Type 1 diabetes were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse video characteristics. Results: The four major themes associated with diabetes burnout were: (i) feeling mentally drained and physically tired of dealing with self-care; (ii) experiencing a detachment from self, diabetes care and support system; (iii) being powerless and paralysed to climb out of diabetes burnout; and (iv) contributing potential factors to diabetes burnout. Conclusions: Self-descriptions of diabetes burnout suggest that it is a combination of emotions and behaviours on a spectrum from exhaustion to detachment accompanied by an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. More studies are needed to further clarify diabetes burnout and its distinction from, or overlap with, other related psychosocial concepts in diabetes care.\t\t\n",
      "(0.522)  Aim To explore the influence of health beliefs and behaviours on diabetes management in British Indians, as successful management of diabetes is dependent on underlying cultural beliefs and behaviours. Background British South Asians are six times more likely to suffer from type II diabetes than those in the general population. Yet, little research has been carried out into beliefs about diabetes among the British Indian population. Method The study used semi-structured interviews, a structured vignette and a pile-sorting exercise. In all, 10 British Indians were interviewed at a General Practice in North West London. Findings Those interviewed were informed about their diabetes but had difficulties in adapting their diet. Themes identified included causal beliefs of diabetes, use of alternative therapies, moderation of food, adaption of exercise regimes and sources of information. All were aware of avoiding certain foods yet some still continued to consume these items. Participants expressed the need for culturally sensitive forums to help manage their diabetes.\t\t\n",
      "(0.503)  Addressing the emotional side of diabetes and its management has received considerable attention in recent years. At the centre of most of these efforts is the concept of diabetes distress', a generic term that captures the primary sources and intensity of emotional distress associated with diabetes and its management over time. As interest in diabetes distress has grown, however, it has been difficult to integrate and translate the various strands of clinical research in a manner that can guide diabetes distress intervention efforts in the real world of clinical care. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by outlining practical strategies for intervention in clinical settings and to assist diabetes healthcare professionals in thinking through how diabetes distress might be addressed practically in their clinics. To address these goals, this review is divided into five sections: a definition of diabetes distress, ways diabetes distress can be assessed and monitored, information about diabetes distress for use in intervention planning, topics to be considered for inclusion in diabetes distress interventions, and alternatives for where in the care process a diabetes distress intervention might be considered. We focus on diabetes distress experienced by adults with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\t\t\n",
      "(0.489)  Aims: Whether diabetes increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) is unclear. Any greater risk may relate to insulin resistance, but many studies did not differentiate between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes for VTE risk. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre, comprising over 530 primary care practices. We determined whether type 1 diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes are independent risk factors for VTE. The index date was 1 January 2009, individuals were followed to 31 December 2018, or censoring. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the risk of VTE in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes relative to no diabetes. The primary outcome was occurrence of VTE. The model was adjusted for potential confounders for VTE. Results: There were 7086 people with type 1 diabetes and 95,566 with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed before 1 January 2009. The non-diabetes group consisted of 1,407,699 people. In the unadjusted analysis, there was no increased risk of VTE with type 1 diabetes (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.761.33) but there was for type 2 diabetes (HR 2.70, 95% CI 2.572.84). In the fully adjusted model, VTE risk was increased in type 1 diabetes (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.111.92), but not with type 2 diabetes (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.981.14). Conclusions: Type 1 diabetes was associated with a greater risk for VTE while type 2 diabetes was not. Further work is needed to determine the reason(s) for this. \n",

Because TTT can be associated with more medication switches, concerns arise regarding whether implementing TTT may increase adverse events and/or resource use. The aim of this study was to examine adverse events and resource use during the preintervention and intervention periods of the TTT intervention trial. Methods: We used data from 6 practices enrolled in an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare adverse events and resource use before (months 19) and during (months 1018) a TTT intervention. The outcomes of interest, adverse events and resource use, were based on medical record review of all rheumatology visits for RA patients before and during the intervention. Results: We examined records for 321 patients before the intervention and 315 during the intervention. An adverse event was recorded in 10.2% of visits before the intervention and 8.8% of visits during the intervention (P = 0.41). Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were taken by 53.6% of patients before the intervention and 49.8% of patients during the intervention (P = 0.73). Rheumatology visits were more frequent before the intervention (mean ± SD 4.0 ± 1.4) than during the intervention (mean ± SD 3.6 ± 1.2; P = 0.02). More visits were accompanied by monitoring laboratory tests before the intervention (90.0%) compared with during the intervention (52.7%; P < 0.001). A greater percentage of visits before the intervention included diagnostic imaging (15.4%) versus during the intervention (8.9%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: We observed similar rates of adverse events before and during the implementation of TTT for RA. Rheumatology visits, use of laboratory monitoring, and diagnostic imaging did not increase during the TTT intervention.\t\t\n",
      "(0.469)  Background: Reducing meat consumption could bring health and environmental benefits, but there is little research to date on effective interventions to achieve this. A non-randomised controlled intervention study was used to evaluate whether prominent positioning of meat-free products in the meat aisle was associated with a change in weekly mean sales of meat and meat-free products. Methods and findings Weekly sales data were obtained from 108 stores: 20 intervention stores that moved a selection of 26 meat-free products into a newly created meat-free bay within the meat aisle and 88 matched control stores. The primary outcome analysis used a hierarchical negative binomial model to compare changes in weekly sales (units) of meat products sold in intervention versus control stores during the main intervention period (Phase I: February 2019 to April 2019). Interrupted time series analysis was also used to evaluate the effects of the Phase I intervention. Moreover, 8 of the 20 stores enhanced the intervention from August 2019 onwards (Phase II intervention) by adding a second bay of meat-free products into the meat aisle, which was evaluated following the same analytical methods. During the Phase I intervention, sales of meat products (units/store/week) decreased in intervention (approximately -6%) and control stores (-5%) without significant differences (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.01 [95% CI 0.95-1.07]. Sales of meat-free products increased significantly more in the intervention (+31%) compared to the control stores (+6%; IRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.30-1.57]), mostly due to increased sales of meat-free burgers, mince, and sausages. Consistent results were observed in interrupted time series analyses where the effect of the Phase II intervention was significant in intervention versus control stores. Conclusions Prominent positioning of meat-free products into the meat aisle in a supermarket was not effective in reducing sales of meat products, but successfully increased sales of meat-free alternatives in the longer term.\t\t\n",
      "(0.453)  Background: For working adults, about one-third of energy is consumed in the workplace making this an important context in which to reduce energy intake to tackle obesity. The aims of the current study were first, to identify barriers to the feasibility and acceptability of implementing calorie labelling in preparation for a larger trial, and second, to estimate the potential impact of calorie labelling on energy purchased in worksite cafeterias. Methods: Six worksite cafeterias were randomised to the intervention starting at one of six fortnightly periods, using a stepped wedge design. The trial was conducted between August and December 2016, across 17 study weeks. The intervention comprised labelling all cafeteria products for which such information was available with their calorie content (e.g. \"250 Calories\") displayed in the same font style and size as for price. A post-intervention survey with cafeteria patrons and interviews with managers and caterers were used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Intervention impact was assessed using generalised linear mixed modelling. The primary outcome was the total energy (kcal) purchased from intervention items in each cafeteria each day. Results: Recruitment and retention of worksite cafeterias proved feasible, with post-intervention feedback suggesting high levels of intervention acceptability. Several barriers to intervention implementation were identified, including chefs' discretion at implementing recipes and the manual recording of sales data. There was no overall effect of the intervention: -0.4% (95%CI -3.8 to 2.9, p = .803). One site showed a statistically significant effect of the intervention, with an estimated 6.6% reduction (95%CI -12.9 to - 0.3, p = .044) in energy purchased in the day following the introduction of calorie labelling, an effect that diminished over time. The remaining five sites did not show robust changes in energy purchased when calorie labelling was introduced. Conclusions: A calorie labelling intervention was acceptable to both cafeteria operators and customers. The predicted effect of labelling to reduce energy purchased was only evident at one out of six sites studied. Before progressing to a full trial, the calorie labelling intervention needs to be optimised, and a number of operational issues resolved.\t\t\n",
      "(0.404)  Background: This paper describes the intervention planning process for the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP), a digital intervention to promote hypertension self-management. It illustrates how a Person-Based Approach can be integrated with theory- and evidence-based approaches. The Person-Based Approach to intervention development emphasises the use of qualitative research to ensure that the intervention is acceptable, persuasive, engaging and easy to implement. Methods: Our intervention planning process comprised two parallel, integrated work streams, which combined theory-, evidence- and person-based elements. The first work stream involved collating evidence from a mixed methods feasibility study, a systematic review and a synthesis of qualitative research. This evidence was analysed to identify likely barriers and facilitators to uptake and implementation as well as design features that should be incorporated in the HOME BP intervention. The second work stream used three complementary approaches to theoretical modelling: developing brief guiding principles for intervention design, causal modelling to map behaviour change techniques in the intervention onto the Behaviour Change Wheel and Normalisation Process Theory frameworks, and developing a logic model. Results: The different elements of our integrated approach to intervention planning yielded important, complementary insights into how to design the intervention to maximise acceptability and ease of implementation by both patients and health professionals. From the primary and secondary evidence, we identified key barriers to overcome (such as patient and health professional concerns about side effects of escalating medication) and effective intervention ingredients (such as providing in-person support for making healthy behaviour changes). Our guiding principles highlighted unique design features that could address these issues (such as online reassurance and procedures for managing concerns). Causal modelling ensured that all relevant behavioural determinants had been addressed, and provided a complete description of the intervention. Our logic model linked the hypothesised mechanisms of action of our intervention to existing psychological theory. Conclusion: Our integrated approach to intervention development, combining theory-, evidence- and person-based approaches, increased the clarity, comprehensiveness and confidence of our theoretical modelling and enabled us to ground our intervention in an in-depth understanding of the barriers and facilitators most relevant to this specific intervention and user population.\t\t\n",
      "(0.402)  Background: A modified theory of planned behaviour (acronym CASCADA) proposes that Conscious knowledge precedes a change in Attitude, which in turn precedes positive deviations from negative Subjective norms, intention to Change, perception of Agency to change, Discussion of possible action, and Action itself. We used this as a results chain to investigate gender-specific behaviour dynamics in chemical-free dengue prevention. Methods: Secondary analysis of the Mexican arm of a cluster randomised controlled trial used household survey data on intermediate outcomes of dengue prevention behaviour. We used a matrix of odds ratios between outcomes, transformed to a symmetrical range (-1, 1), to compute fuzzy transitive closure of the results chain for control and intervention clusters, then for male and female respondents separately in each group. Transitive closure of a map computes the influence of each factor on each other factor, taking account of all influences in the system. Cumulative net influence was the sum of influences across the results chain. Results: Responses of 5042 women and 1143 men in 45 intervention clusters contrasted with those of 5025 women and 1179 men in 45 control clusters. Control clusters showed a distal block (negative influence) in the results chain with a cumulative net influence of 0.88; intervention clusters showed no such block and a cumulative net influence of 1.92. Female control respondents, like the overall control picture, showed a distal block, whereas female intervention responses showed no such blocks (cumulative net influence 0.78 and 1.73 respectively). Male control respondents showed weak distal blocks. Male intervention responses showed several new negative influences and a reduction of cumulative net influence (1.38 in control and 1.11 in intervention clusters). Conclusions: The overall influence of the intervention across the results chain fits with the trial findings, but is different for women and men. Among women, the intervention overcame blocks and increased the cumulative net influence of knowledge on action. Among men, the intervention did not reinforce prevention behaviour. This might be related to emphasis, during the intervention, on women's participation and empowerment. The fuzzy transitive closure of the CASCADA map usefully highlights the differences between gender-specific results chains. Trial registration: ISRCTN27581154. \n",

      "(0.739)  Objective: Clinicians spend significant time working in the electronic health record (EHR). The US is an outlier in EHR time, suggesting that EHR-related work may be driven in part by the legal environment and threat of malpractice. To assess this, we evaluate the association between state-level malpractice climate and clinician time spent in the EHR. Materials and Methods: We use EHR metadata from 351 ambulatory care health systems in the United States using Epic from January-August 2019 combined with state-level data on malpractice incidence and payouts. We used descriptive statistics to measure variation in clinician EHR time, including total EHR time, documentation time per day, and after-hours EHR time per day. Multi-variable regression evaluated the association between clinicians in high malpractice states and EHR use. Results: We found no association between location in a state in the top-quartile of malpractice payouts and time spent in the EHR per day, time spent in the EHR outside of scheduled hours, or time spent documenting per day, except for a subgroup of the clinicians in the highest malpractice specialties, where there was a small increase in EHR time per day (B = 6.08 min, P < 0.001) and time spent documenting notes (B = 2.77 min, P < 0.001). Discussion: State-level differences in malpractice incidence are unlikely to be a significant driver of EHR work for most clinicians. Conclusion: Policymakers seeking to address EHR documentation burden should examine burden driven by other socio-technical demands on clinician time, such as billing or quality measurement.\t\t\n",
      "(0.717)  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union provides for an extension of Canadian patents for prescription drugs by up to 2 years. One of the arguments advanced for longer patent time is to compensate companies for the length of the overall drug development time (the time between patent application and market approval). This study investigates overall development time in Canada for different groups of drugs approved between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018 and how many of these drugs are eligible for up to 2 years of patent term extension. Based on a list of patents and dates of market approval, the change in overall development time for all drugs was calculated along with whether there were differences in development time between different groups of drugs. Using Canadian patent filing dates, overall development time for all drugs went from a mean of 2240 days (95% CI: 1832, 2648) in 2009 to 4197 days (95% CI: 3728, 4665) in 2018 (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < .0001). Using first global patent filing dates, overall development time went from a mean of 4481 days (95% CI: 3053, 5908) in 2009 to 6298 days (95% CI: 4839, 7756) in 2018 (ANOVA, P = .0118). There was a statistically significant difference in the overall development mean time between small molecule drugs (3553, 95% CI: 3361, 3746) and biologics (3903, 95% CI: 3595, 4212), (t test, P = .0487) when using Canadian patent filing dates but not when first global patent filing dates were used. There was no statistically significant change in overall development time among drugs that were substantial, moderate or little to none additional therapeutic value compared to existing drugs. Out of 238 drugs, 218 (91.6%) would have been eligible for patent term extension with 195 (80.7%) eligible for the full 2 years. Patent term extension does not appear to be justified based on changes in overall development time, except possibly in the case of biologics. There are also trade offs in terms of increased expenditures that need to be considered if patent terms are lengthened.\t\t\n",
      "(0.573)  Canada has strengthened intellectual property (IP) protections for pharmaceutical drugs several times over the last 3 decades. This study investigates whether the IP changes had an effect on the market exclusivity time of brand products on the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) formulary. We constructed a database that included the first brand approval date for drugs launched between 1974 and 2012, the first ODB listing date of the brand drug, and the first ODB listing date of the generic form of the drug. We then calculated the time of formulary exclusivity to detect any changes in market exclusivity times associated with changes to Canadas IP regimen. There were 595 drugs launched between 1974 and 2012 that were available for analysis. Exclusivity gradually declined from the late 1970s to 1990. Drugs approved in 2004 received 7.6 years of exclusivity, and drugs approved in 2005 received 5 years of exclusivity. Over the time period we analyzed, market exclusivity time of brand drugs experienced marked changes, but we did not detect any systematic effects of Canadas stronger pharmaceutical IP laws on the market exclusivity.\t\t\n",
      "(0.565)  Objectives This study examines the length of time between when a patent application is filed in Canada for a new drug and when it is available for patients (time to market) and various components of that time. It also looks at whether various factors explain the time between patent application to New Drug Submission (NDS) and compares Canadian and American times. Drugs approved between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 are examined. Design Descriptive study. Data sources Websites from Health Canada, Food and Drug Administration, Merck Index, United States Patent and Trademark Office, WHO and previously published articles. Interventions None. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes are time to market, time from patent application to NDS (pre-NDS time), review time, time from approval to availability (postapproval time) and factors that may influence the pre-NDS time. The secondary outcome is a comparison of Canadian and American review times and times between patent application and approval. Results There were 113 drugs available for analysis. The median time to market was 11.80 years (IQR 9.40-14.05). The component median times were pre-NDS 10 years (IQR 8.05-12.80), review time 0.96 years (IQR 0.75-1.15) and postapproval time 0.15 years (IQR 0.08-0.28). Less than 8% of the pre-NDS time was explained by the factors that were analysed in a multiple linear regression equation. There was no statistically significant difference between Canadian and American pre-NDS times. Conclusion Once a drug reaches the market, companies have a median of 8.2 years before the patent expires and generics can reach the market. Most of the time between the filing of a patent application and when a drug is marketed is determined by decisions that are largely under the control of the company.\t\t\n",
      "(0.558)  Background: Drone-delivered defibrillators have the potential to significantly reduce response time for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, optimal policies for the dispatch of such drones are not yet known. We sought to develop dispatch rules for a network of defibrillator-carrying drones. Methods: We identified all suspected OHCAs in Peel Region, Ontario, Canada from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2019. We developed drone dispatch rules based on the difference between a predicted ambulance response time to a calculated drone response time for each OHCA. Ambulance response times were predicted using linear regression and neural network models, while drone response times were calculated using drone specifications from recent pilot studies and the literature. We evaluated the dispatch rules based on response time performance and dispatch decisions, comparing them to two baseline policies of never dispatching and always dispatching drones. Results: A total of 3573 suspected OHCAs were included in the study with median and mean historical ambulance response times of 5.8 and 6.2 min. All machine learning-based dispatch rules significantly reduced the median response time to 3.9 min and mean response time to 4.14.2 min (all P < 0.001) and were non-inferior to universally dispatching drones (all P < 0.001) while reducing the number of drone flights by up to 30%. Dispatch rules with more drone flights achieved higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy. Conclusion: Machine learning-based dispatch rules for drone-delivered defibrillators can achieve similar response time reductions as universal drone dispatch while substantially reducing the number of trips. \n",

Design Population-based retrospective observational study using linked health administrative databases. Records of hospitalisations and emergency department visits were searched to identify cases using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada diagnostic codes. Participants All Ontario residents. Primary outcome measures Incidence rates of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral venous thrombosis during five prepandemic years (2015-2019) and 2020. Results The average annual population was 14 million with 51% female. The mean annual rates per 100 000 population during 2015-2019 were 127.1 (95% CI 126.2 to 127.9) for ischaemic stroke, 22.0 (95% CI 21.6 to 22.3) for intracerebral haemorrhage, 9.4 (95% CI 9.2 to 9.7) for subarachnoid haemorrhage, 86.8 (95% CI 86.1 to 87.5) for deep vein thrombosis, 63.7 (95% CI 63.1 to 64.3) for pulmonary embolism, 6.1 (95% CI 5.9 to 6.3) for idiopathic thrombocytopaenia, 1.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.7) for disseminated intravascular coagulation, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.6) for cerebral venous thrombosis. Rates were lower in 2020 than during the prepandemic years for ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and idiopathic thrombocytopaenia. Rates were generally consistent over time, except for pulmonary embolism, which increased from 57.1 to 68.5 per 100 000 between 2015 and 2019. Rates were higher for females than males for subarachnoid haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and cerebral venous thrombosis, and vice versa for ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage. Rates increased with age for most of these conditions, but idiopathic thrombocytopaenia demonstrated a bimodal distribution with incidence peaks at 0-19 years and =60 years. Conclusions Our estimated background rates help contextualise observed events of these potential adverse events of special interest and to detect potential safety signals related to COVID-19 vaccines.\t\t\n",
      "(0.459)  Objectives An evidence-based emergency department (ED) atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) pathway was developed to improve care. The primary objective was to measure rates of new anticoagulation (AC) on ED discharge for AFF patients who were not AC correctly upon presentation.Methods This is a pre-post evaluation from April to December 2013 measuring the impact of our pathway on rates of new AC and other performance measures in patients with uncomplicated AFF solely managed by emergency physicians. A standardized chart review identified demographics, comorbidities, and ED treatments. The primary outcome was the rate of new AC. Secondary outcomes were ED length of stay (LOS), referrals to AFF clinic, ED revisit rates, and 30-day rates of return visits for congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, major bleeding, and death.Results ED AFF patients totalling 301 (129 pre-pathway [PRE]; 172 post-pathway [POST]) were included; baseline demographics were similar between groups. The rates of AC at ED presentation were 18.6% (PRE) and 19.7% (POST). The rates of new AC on ED discharge were 48.6 % PRE (95% confidence interval [CI] 42.1%-55.1%) and 70.2% POST (62.1%-78.3%) (20.6% [p<0.01; 15.1-26.3]). Median ED LOS decreased from 262 to 218 minutes (44 minutes [p<0.03; 36.2-51.8]). Thirty-day rates of ED revisits for CHF decreased from 13.2% to 2.3% (10.9%; p<0.01; 8.1%-13.7%), and rates of other measures were similar.Conclusions The evidence-based pathway led to an improvement in the rate of patients with new AC upon discharge, a reduction in ED LOS, and decreased revisit rates for CHF.\t\t\n",
      "(0.439)  Background: Given concerns about risks associated with the growing use of mobile phones over recent decades, the authors analyzed temporal trends in incidence rates of nonmalignant meningioma and vestibular schwannoma in the United States. Methods: The incidence of nonmalignant meningioma and vestibular schwannoma among adults in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries during 2004 through 2017 was evaluated according to the method of diagnosis: microscopically (MC) or radiographically confirmed (RGC). Annual percent changes (APCs) and 95% CIs were estimated using log-linear models. Results: Overall meningioma rates (n = 108,043) increased significantly from 2004 to 2009 (APC, 5.4%; 95% CI, 4.4%-6.4%) but subsequently rose at a slower pace through 2017 (APC, 1.0%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.5%). Rates for MC meningiomas changed little from 2004 to 2017 (APC, -0.3%; 95% CI, -0.7%, 0.1%) but rose rapidly for RGC meningiomas until 2009 (APC, 9.5%; 95% CI, 7.8%-11.1%) and rose more modestly thereafter (APC, 2.3%; 95% CI, 1.5%-3.0%). Overall vestibular schwannoma rates (n = 17,475) were stable (APC, 0.4%; 95% CI, -0.2%, 1.0%), but MC vestibular schwannoma rates decreased (APC, -1.9%; 95% CI, -2.7%, -1.1%), whereas RGC vestibular schwannoma rates rose (2006-2017: APC, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.0%). For each tumor, the trends by diagnostic method were similar for each sex and each racial/ethnic group, but RGC diagnosis was more likely in older patients and for smaller tumors. Meningioma trends and the proportion of RGC diagnoses varied notably by registry. Conclusions: Overall trends obscured differences by diagnostic method in this first large, detailed assessment, but the recent stable rates argue against an association with mobile phone use. Variation among registries requires evaluation to improve the registration of these nonmalignant tumors. Lay Summary: The etiology of most benign meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas is poorly understood, but concerns have been raised about whether mobile phone use contributes to risk of developing these tumors. Descriptive studies examining temporal trends could provide insight; however, globally, few registries collect these nonmalignant cases. In the United States, reporting benign meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas became required by law in 2004. This was the first large, systematic study to quantify and characterize incidence trends for meningioma and vestibular schwannoma according to whether the tumors were diagnosed microscopically or only radiographically. Differential trends across registries and by diagnostic method suggest that caution should be used when interpreting the patterns.\t\t\n",
      "(0.435)  Introduction Suicide rates and the proportion of alcohol-involved suicides rose during the 20082009 recession. Associations between county-level poverty, foreclosures, and unemployment and suicide rates and proportion of alcohol-involved suicides were investigated. Methods In 2015, National Violent Death Reporting System data from 16 states in 20052011 were utilized to calculate suicide rates and a measure of alcohol involvement in suicides at the county level. Panel models with year and state fixed effects included county-level measures of unemployment, foreclosure, and poverty rates. Results Poverty rates were strongly associated with suicide rates for both genders and all age groups, were positively associated with alcohol involvement in suicides for men aged 4564 years, and negatively associated for men aged 2044 years. Foreclosure rates were negatively associated with suicide rates for women and those aged =65 years but positively related for those aged 4564 years. Unemployment rate effects on suicide rates were mediated by poverty rates in all groups. Conclusions Population risk of suicide was most clearly associated with county-level poverty rates, indicating that programs addressing area poverty should be targeted for reducing suicide risk. Poverty rates were also associated with increased alcohol involvement for men aged 4564 years, indicating a role for alcohol in suicide for this working-aged group. However, negative associations between economic indicators and alcohol involvement were found for four groups, suggesting that non-economic factors or more general economic effects not captured by these indicators may have played a larger role in alcohol-related suicide increases.\t\t\n",
      "(0.435)  Background: Shopping for health insurance is encouraged as a way to find the most affordable coverage that best meets an enrollees needs. However, the extent to which individuals switch insurance and subsequent changes in health care utilization that might arise, particularly new physician visits, are not well understood. Objective: To examine the relationship between insurance switching and new physician and emergency department visits around the time of a switch. Design: Observational study using a difference-in-differences design to compare those switching insurance carriers with propensity score-matched controls who did not switch, stratified based on whether individuals initially had private or Medicaid insurance coverage. All analyses adjusted for individual and insurance characteristics. Participants: Continuously insured, non-elderly individuals with private or Medicaid insurance coverage in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013. Main Measures: Rates of new primary care and specialist physician visits, as well as rates of emergency department visits. Key Results: Before matching, among 1,628,057 continuously insured individuals, 418,231 (26%) switched insurance carriers during a 2-year period. Characteristics of switchers and non-switchers were similar after matching (n = 316,343 in each group). After matching, switching plans was associated with a 203% and 47.5% increase in the rate of new primary care physician visits following switching for those initially with Medicaid or private coverage, respectively (both p < 0.001), with a large short-term increase, diminishing over time. Among those with Medicaid coverage, switching was associated with a 14.9% higher rate of ED visits during the month of switching (p < 0.001), but otherwise decreased modestly after switching. Conclusions: Insurance switching is common, and is associated with increased new physician visits and temporarily increased ED use among the publicly insured. As insurance markets become more volatile in the current policy environment, understanding changes in utilization after insurance switching may become increasingly important. \n",

      "(0.388)  Background Cam morphology, a distinct bony morphology of the hip, is prevalent in many athletes, and a risk factor for hip-related pain and osteoarthritis. Secondary cam morphology, due to existing or previous hip disease (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease), is well-described. Cam morphology not clearly associated with a disease is a challenging concept for clinicians, scientists and patients. We propose this morphology, which likely develops during skeletal maturation as a physiological response to load, should be referred to as primary cam morphology. The aim of this study was to introduce and clarify the concept of primary cam morphology. Design We conducted a concept analysis of primary cam morphology using articles that reported risk factors associated with primary cam morphology; we excluded articles on secondary cam morphology. The concept analysis method is a rigorous eight-step process designed to clarify complex ' concepts'; the end product is a precise definition that supports the theoretical basis of the chosen concept. Results We propose five defining attributes of primary cam morphology-tissue type, size, site, shape and ownership-in a new conceptual and operational definition. Primary cam morphology is a cartilage or bony prominence (bump) of varying size at the femoral head-neck junction, which changes the shape of the femoral head from spherical to aspherical. It often occurs in asymptomatic male athletes in both hips. The cartilage or bone alpha angle (calculated from radiographs, CT or MRI) is the most common method to measure cam morphology. We found inconsistent reporting of primary cam morphology taxonomy, terminology, and how the morphology is operationalised. Conclusion We introduce and clarify primary cam morphology, and propose a new conceptual and operational definition. Several elements of the concept of primary cam morphology remain unclear and contested. Experts need to agree on the new taxonomy, terminology and definition that better reflect the primary cam morphology landscape- A bog-standard bump in most athletic hips, and a possible hip disease burden in a selected few.\t\t\n",
      "(0.381)  Background: Physician assistants (PAs) are often suggested as a partial solution to predicted primary care workforce shortages, but a declining proportion of PAs are entering primary care practice. Policy efforts have focused on increasing primary care PA supply, but low labor market demand might be constricting the primary care PA pipeline. Method: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we compare primary care and specialty job postings to each other and to occupied PA positions. Job posting data for 2014 are from a leading labor analytics firm. Results: Only 18% of job postings were in primary care, compared with 27% of occupied PA positions. The proportion of postings that were for primary care varied widely by state (9% to 40%) and were highest in the West. Discussion: Job availability is a potential barrier to PAs practicing in primary care, especially in some locations. Other job factors are examined and policy solutions are suggested.\t\t\n",
      "(0.361)  Part 1 of this essay argued that the root causes of primary cares problems lie in (1) the low percent of national health expenditures dedicated to primary care and (2) overly large patient panels that clinicians without a team are unable to manage, leading to widespread burnout and poor patient access. Part 2 explores policies and practice changes that could solve or mitigate these primary care problems. Initiatives attempting to improve primary care are discussed. Diffuse multi-component ini-tiativespatient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), accountable care organizations (ACOs), and Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+)have had limited success in addressing primary cares core problems. More focused initiativescare management, open access, and telehealthoffer more promise. To truly revitalize primary care, 2 fundamental changes are needed: (1) a substantially greater percent of health expenditures dedicated to primary care, and (2) the building of powerful teams that add capacity to care for large panels while reducing burnout. Part 2 of the essay reviews 3 approaches to increasing primary care spending: state-level legislation, eliminating Medicares disparity between primary care and procedural specialty reimbursement, and efforts by health systems. The final section of Part 2 addresses the building of powerful core and interprofessional teams.\t\t\n",
      "(0.328)  Introduction: Primary cam morphology is a mostly benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip, but it is highly prevalent in many athlete populations. In the small proportion of athletes for whom it is not benign, the resulting hip osteoarthritis can be debilitating. Clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers do not yet agree on important primary cam morphology elements. We aimed to ascertain and improve the level of agreement on primary cam morphology definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures. Methods: To collect and aggregate informed opinions, an expert panel - the Young Athlete's Hip Research Collaborative - rated primary cam morphology definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome statements through an online Delphi exercise followed by an online meeting to explore areas of tension and dissent. Reporting followed Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies. Results: A diverse and inclusive Delphi panel (n=65 for rounds 1 and 2, representing 18 countries; 6 stakeholder groups; 40% women) agreed on 35 of 47 statements in 4 domains, while surfacing areas of tension and dissent. This Delphi panel agreed on four key issues essential to moving research and clinical care forward around primary cam morphology. They agreed on: (1) definition, confirming its conceptual attributes (tissue type, size, location, shape and ownership); (2) terminology - use 'morphology' and not terms with a negative connotation like 'lesion', 'abnormality' or 'deformity'; (3) taxonomy, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology, and (4) imaging outcomes, a continuous bone/cartilage alpha angle on radial femoral head-neck MRI for primary cam morphology aetiology research. Conclusion: This consensus provides athletes, patients, clinicians and researchers with a strong foundation to guide more precise communication, better clinical decision-making and higher value research about primary cam morphology and its natural history.\t\t\n",
      "(0.303)  Objective To develop a composite measure of primary care quality and apply it to Haitis primary care system. Methods Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiatives framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.000.49, 0.500.74 and 0.751.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively. Findings Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4%), management and organization (91; 12%) and primary care functions (43; 5%). Although about 91% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23% of the entire population  including just 5% of the rural population  had access to primary care of good quality. Conclusion Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas. Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems. \n",

      "(0.419)  The literature indicates males are more risk-seeking than females. This study examines whether anxiety increases the gender gap in risk-seeking, whereas sadness closes the gender gap in risk-seeking, a pattern we call the Emotional Fluctuation Effect. In two studies, one with an adolescent sample and the other employing an adult sample, we find similar levels of risk-seeking when males are in anxious or sad states. By contrast, anxious females are less riskseeking than anxious males (study 1 and study 2), and anxious adolescent girls are less risk-seeking than sad adolescent girls (study 1). Together our findings indicate that gender differences in risk-seeking can be explained in part by anxious girls and women avoiding risky behaviors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.402)  Objective: Wine glass size may influence perceived volume and subsequently purchasing and consumption. Using a larger glass to serve the same portions of wine was found to increase wine sales by 9.4% (95% CI 1.9, 17.5) in a recent study conducted in one bar. The current study aimed to replicate this previous work in two other bars using a wider range of glass sizes. To match the previous study, a repeated multiple treatment reversal design, during which wine was served in glasses of the same design but different sizes, was used. The study was conducted in two bars in Cambridge, England, using glass sizes of 300, 370, 510 ml (Bar 1) and 300 and 510 ml (Bar 2). Customers purchased their choice of a 750 ml bottle, or standard UK measures of 125, 175 or 250 ml of wine, each of which was served with the same glass. Results: Bar 1 Daily wine volume (ml) purchased was 10.5% (95% CI 1.0, 20.9) higher when sold in 510 ml compared to 370 ml glasses; but sales were not significantly higher with 370 ml versus 300 ml glasses (6.5%, 95% CI -5.2, 19.6). Bar 2 Findings were inconclusive as to whether daily wine purchased differed when using 510 ml versus 300 ml glasses (-1.1%, 95% CI -12.6, 11.9). These results provide a partial replication of previous work showing that introducing larger glasses (without manipulating portion size) increases purchasing. Understanding the mechanisms by which wine glass size influences consumption may elucidate when the effect can be expected and when not. Trial registration This study is a replication study, based on the procedure set out in the trial registration for the study that it attempts to replicate (ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN12018175)\t\t\n",
      "(0.396)  Despite its practical and symbolic importance, the role of space in higher education remains under-researched. This study develops an understanding of student experience of the campus as a learning landscape. It is based on 28 participatory walking interviews with students, including the hand drawing of a campus map. Participants tended to see learning as about individual study or working alongside others, and rarely mentioned lectures. The choice of space to study was often shaped by convenience, and appeared to be somewhat static and habitual. There was a lack of exploration and only a limited sense of the benefit of fitting the learning task to the space. Yet students felt a sense of ownership and safety on campus. They actively used the characteristics of space to manage their own attention through studying where there were visible cues to study and controlling distraction.\t\t\n",
      "(0.385)  Background: Reducing alcohol consumption across populations would prevent many non-communicable diseases. Large packages increase food and non-alcoholic drink consumption and large glasses increase wine consumption. Smaller bottles may reduce alcohol consumption but their impact is uncertain. This study aims to (i) explore the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption and (ii) estimate the effect size and variance of the intervention on consumption to inform the design of future studies. Methods: Cross-over randomised study in which 16 households in Cambridge, England, consuming at least two 750-ml bottles of wine each week, received a pre-set volume of wine biweekly for 4 weeks, in 750-ml and 375-ml bottles, in random order. Consumption was assessed by recording the number of empty and partially full bottles at the end of each biweekly period. At the end of the study, household representatives were interviewed about their experiences of participating in the study. Results: The study procedures proved feasible. Comparable to similar trials, 14% of identified eligible households (18/125) consented to participate in the study. Attrition between consent and study completion was 11% (2/18) and 0% between study periods and 13% of households (2/16) correctly identified the study aim. The study procedures were considered acceptable. After adjusting for guest and out-of-home consumption, the difference in consumption between the 750-ml (3385.2 ml; SD = 1698.5) and 375-ml bottles (3376.7 ml; SD = 1719.0) was 8.4 ml (SD = 1235.4; 95%CI - 596.9, 613.8). Results suggest a possible order effect, with households receiving the 375-ml bottles first consuming more wine out of the 750-ml bottles and vice versa. This might also reflect an increase in consumption with study duration. Households receiving the 375-ml bottles first (6315.9 ml; SD = 3293.5) also drank less wine overall than those receiving the 750-ml bottles first (7335.4 ml; SD = 3735.4). Discussion: The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of running a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption. Due to the heterogeneous patterning of results, a future study will be powered using the variance observed in the current study to detect a meaningful reduction of 250 ml of wine when consumed from smaller compared with larger bottles.

      "(0.758)  In this short-term longitudinal study, 30 preschool-aged children with autism were first observed in Ainsworths Strange Situation Procedure and, separately, interacting with the primary caregiver in the home. One year later, each child completed both a developmental assessment and an observational assessment of empathic responding. Behaviors typical for children with autism were distinguished from behaviors suggestive of relationally based attachment disorganization. Forty-five percent of the children were classified as securely attached. The secure group demonstrated language skills superior to those of the insecurely attached group, concurrently and during the follow-up. Compared to parents of children who were insecurely attached, parents of securely attached children were rated as more sensitive. Compared to both organized insecure and disorganized children, secure children were rated as more responsive to an examiners apparent distress during the follow-up relative to their ratings at intake, whereas empathy ratings of children with insecure classifications did not increase. Importantly, attachment security was associated with empathy above and beyond the contribution of childrens language level. These results indicate that the sequelae of attachment security in autism may be similar to those documented for typically developing children.\t\t\n",

Elucidating a clear picture of these profiles is essential. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) were analysed from cohort of children with ASD (n = 1430), ADHD (n = 1193), and RAD/DAD (n = 39). Kruskal-Wallis Tests and network analytic techniques were used to investigate symptom profiles. Children with ASD experienced more emotional problems, peer problems and fewer prosocial behaviours. Children with ADHD and RAD/DAD had higher levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems. Overall, ASD and ADHD networks were highly correlated (rs = 0.82), and we did not observe a statistically significant difference in terms of global Strength.\t\t\n",
      "(0.609)  Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and causes of blindness (BL), severe visual impairment (SVI), moderate visual impairment (ModVI) and mild visual impairment (MildVI) in children in Narayani Zone, Nepal. Methods: In 2017, 100 population clusters within the Narayani Zone of Nepal were selected using RAAB software. Children (aged 015 years) suspected of having visual problems were identified using Key Informants (KIs) and school teachers and were referred for ophthalmologic examination. Eye care staff actively sought children who failed to present for examination. Causes of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI were categorized using standard World Health Organization definitions. Results: Of 76,588 children selected, 72,900 (95%) were screened. Of 2,158 children referred for examination, 1,322 were referred by teachers and 836 by KIs. A total of 1,617 (75%) children received a detailed examination, of whom 128 children [65 girls (51%)] mean age of 9.4 (± 4.1 years) were confirmed to have BL 7 (5.5%), SVI 16 (12.5%), ModVI 19 (15%) or MildVI 86 (67%). The combined prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI was 175/100,000 (95% CI 172178/100,000); BL/SVI/ModVI was 55/100,000 (95% CI 5357/100,000) and the combined BL/SVI estimate was 30/100,000 (95% CI 2931/100,000). The leading causes of BL/SVI/MVI were refractive error 23 (55%) and whole globe disorders 5 (12%). Total avoidable causes were 31 (74%). Conclusion: The prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI among children in Narayani Zone was moderate and included a high proportion of avoidable and treatable cases. Pediatric ophthalmic services need improvement, mainly refractive error correction in rural areas of Nepal.\t\t\n",
      "(0.591)  Background: The ecosystemic approach to children's needs demands a cohesive response from societies, communities, and families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the choices societies made to protect their community members from the virus could have created contexts of child neglect. With the closure of services and institutions, societies were no longer available to help meet the needs of children. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine parents reports on the response their children received to their needs during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: During the period of the spring 2020 lockdown, 414 parents in the province of Quebec, Canada, completed an online questionnaire about the impact of the crisis on the response their children received to their needs. Results: Compared to parents of younger children, parents of older children reported less fulfillment of their child's needs in three measured domains, namely cognitive and affective, security, and basic care needs. Conclusion: These results are discussed in light of the policies and the resources societies have put in place during the crisis to help families meet the needs of their children. Societies must learn from this crisis to put children at the top of their priorities in the face of a societal crisis. Thoughtful discussions and energy must be given to ensure that, while facing a crisis, the developmental trajectories of children are not sacrificed.\t\t\n",

Understanding how they interact with healthcare systems is fundamental to efforts to improve their health and well-being. Methods: We surveyed 75 street- and community-based children in Battambang, Cambodia regarding their healthcare-seeking practices and related stigma. Results: For demographically similar street and community children, hospitals and pharmacies were preferred healthcare institutions, with this choice being motivated by the caretaker's decision or cost. Street children reported increased fear of being refused treatment. Conclusions: Street children and demographically similar community children have similar healthcare-seeking practices and preferences, although street children face increased stigmatization. \n",

      "(0.46)  Purpose: To examine the association between contextual factors, represented by geographic and community health variables, and suicide among rural and urban Department of Veterans Affairs health care users (VA users). Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 12,700,847 VA users between 2003 and 2017. We assigned contextual factors based on individuals home address at the ZIP Code (area deprivation), county (sunlight exposure, altitude, and community health), and state level (firearm ownership), using publicly available data sources. We grouped contextual factors by quintiles or prespecified thresholds, depending on the nature of each variable. We obtained mortality data from the National Death Index. We measured the effect of living in a place with the highest versus lowest level of each contextual factor on odds of suicide using logistic regression, adjusting for individual compositional factors abstracted from VA electronic medical records data. We used random forest modeling to build prediction models for suicide based on contextual factors among rural and urban veterans. Findings: Almost all contextual factors we examined were significantly associated with suicide among rural and urban VA users, even after adjusting for individual compositional factors. However, no contextual variables were strong protective or risk factors (0.5<OR>2.0), and prediction models leveraging these contextual factors had poor accuracy among both rural (0.51, 95% CI: 0.48-0.54) and urban (0.53, 95% CI: 0.51-0.55) VA users. Conclusions: A wide variety of contextual factors is significantly associated with suicide among rural and urban VA users. However, the factors we measured contributed very little to individual-level suicide risk.\t\t\n",
      "(0.375)  The objectives of this paper are to: (1) identify contextual factors such as policy that impacted the implementation of community-based primary health care (CBPHC) innovations among 12 Canadian research teams and (2) describe strategies used by the teams to address contextual factors influencing implementation of CBPHC innovations. In primary care settings, consideration of contextual factors when implementing change has been recognized as critically important to success. However, contextual factors are rarely recorded, analyzed or considered when implementing change. The lack of consideration of contextual factors has negative implications not only for successfully implementing primary health care (PHC) innovations, but also for their sustainability and scalability. For this evaluation, data collection was conducted using self-administered questionnaires and follow-up telephone interviews with team representatives. We used a combination of directed and conventional content analysis approaches to analyze the questionnaire and interview data. Representatives from all 12 teams completed the questionnaire and 11 teams participated in the interviews; 40 individuals participated in this evaluation. Four themes representing contextual factors that impacted the implementation of CBPHC innovations were identified: (I) diversity of jurisdictions (II) complexity of interactions and collaborations (III) policy, and (IV) the multifaceted nature of PHC. The teams used six strategies to address these contextual factors including: (1) conduct an environmental scan at the beginning (2) maintaining engagement among partners and stakeholders by encouraging open and inclusive communication; (3) contextualizing the innovation for different settings; (4) anticipating and addressing changes, delays, and the need for additional resources; (5) fostering a culture of research and innovation among partners and stakeholders; and (6) ensuring information about the innovation is widely available. Implementing CBPHC innovations across jurisdictions is complex and involves navigating through multiple contextual factors. Awareness of the dynamic nature of context should be considered when implementing innovations.\t\t\n",

Inspired by the concept of SE, we conducted a mixed methods study of a smartphone application (app) as a platform of SE. Objectives were to: (phase 1 quantitative) estimate the extent to which weekly alerts on the app can stimulate medical residents to visit the app, (connection of phases) identify participants for a second qualitative phase, and (phase 2 qualitative) describe factors, from the resident perspective, which influence sustainable participation in SE, and describe strategies for improvement of the app. Methodology and methods: phase-1 design was pre-experimental, phase-2 design was qualitative descriptive (deductive-inductive thematic analysis). Results: We observed a stimulating effect of weekly alerts for the first two months of the one-year study. Per participant, alert visits varied from 0 to 34 (mean = 1.7, SD = 4.5) and total page visits varied from 1 to 442 (mean = 28.3, SD = 61.4). Barriers and facilitators to sustainable participation in SE fell into five dimensions: user-related factors, information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors. Four strategies for app improvement were described. In conclusion, we propose five dimensions pertaining to potential predictors of sustainable participation in SE to deliver clinical information.\t\t\n",

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study in December 2015 included 1305 homes in eight urban clusters considered representative of Acapulco in southern Mexico. Administered questionnaires collated information on 5870 individuals, including sociodemographic variables, a history of chronic conditions, and the self-reporting of chikungunya. Bivariate and multivariate analyses relied on a cluster-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel procedure to identify the factors associated with chikungunya and its relapse. Results: Some 66% (3531/5870) of the population reported suffering chikungunya and 31.1% (1098/3531) reported a relapse. Factors associated with relapse included the severity of the chikungunya case (odds ratio [OR]: 3.35; clusters adjusted 95% confidence interval [95% CIca]: 3.16-3.55); history of arthralgia (OR: 2.96; 95% CIca: 2.27-3.86); age 30 years or older (OR: 1.85; 95% CIca: 1.72-1.98); female (OR: 1.64; 95% CIca: 1.42-1.90); and higher education households (OR: 1.18; 95% CIca: 1.11-1.27). Conclusions: The high occurrence of chikungunya and its relapse are a public health problem. The factors associated with relapse do not immediately suggest specific prevention strategies but emphasize the dire need for effective approaches to vector control. \n",

      "(0.529)  Twin studies suggest a familial aggregation of bladder cancer, but elements of this increased familial risk of bladder cancer are not well understood. To characterize familial risk of bladder cancer, we examined the relationship between family history of bladder and other types of cancer among first-degree relatives and risk of bladder cancer in 1193 bladder cancer cases and 1418 controls in a large population-based case-control study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between family history of bladder cancer (defined as at least one first-degree family member with bladder cancer or a cancer of any other site). We also evaluated cancer aggregation of specific sites in family members. Participants with a first-degree relative with bladder cancer had nearly double the risk of bladder cancer (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) as those without a family history of bladder cancer. Risk was increased for having a sibling with bladder cancer (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.3) compared to no siblings with cancer. Bladder cancer risk was elevated when participants reported a first-degree relative with a history of female genital cancer (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), melanoma (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.6), and tobacco-associated cancer (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.06-1.6). These findings add to evidence of a familial predisposition to bladder cancer. Clarification of the aggregation of bladder cancer in families and with other cancer sites will be of interest as many loci and common polymorphisms related to bladder cancer have yet to be identified in large genomic studies.\t\t\n",
      "(0.491)  Background & aims: Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which according to experimental research modulate tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We employed the Mendelian randomization design to test the hypothesis that higher plasma phospholipid AA concentrations are associated with increased risk of 10 site-specific cancers. Methods: Two genetic variants associated with plasma phospholipid concentrations of AA (rs174547 in FADS1 [P = 3.0 × 10-971] and rs16966952 in PDXDC1 [P = 2.4 × 10-10]) in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium were used as genetic instruments. The associations of those variants with cancer were taken from the UK Biobank (n = 367,643), FinnGen consortium (n = 135,638), International Lung Cancer Consortium (n = 27,209), Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (n = 140,254), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (n = 228,951), Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (n = 66,450), and BioBank Japan (n = 212,453). Results: Higher genetically predicted plasma phospholipid AA concentrations were associated with increased risk of colorectal and lung cancer. Results were consistent across data sources and variants. The combined odds ratios per standard deviation increase of AA concentrations were 1.08 (95% CI 1.051.11; P = 6.3 × 10-8) for colorectal cancer and 1.07 (95%CI 1.051.10; P = 3.5 × 10-7) for lung cancer. Genetically predicted AA concentrations had a suggestive positive association with esophageal cancer (odds ratio 1.09; 95% CI 1.021.17; P = 0.016) but were not associated with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, bladder, prostate, breast, uterus, or ovary. Conclusion: These results indicate that AA may be implicated in the development of colorectal and lung cancer and possibly esophageal cancer. Treatments with plasma AA-lowering properties should be evaluated for clinical benefit.\t\t\n",
      "(0.463)  Bidirectional gene promoters affect the transcription of two genes, leading to the hypothesis that they should exhibit protection against genetic or epigenetic changes in cancer. Therefore, they provide an excellent opportunity to learn about promoter susceptibility to somatic alteration in tumors. We tested this hypothesis using data from genome-scale DNA methylation (14 cancer types), simple somatic mutation (10 cancer types), and copy number variation profiling (14 cancer types). For DNA methylation, the difference in rank differential methylation between tumor and tumor-adjacent normal matched samples based on promoter type was tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used to compare differences in simple somatic mutations. For copy number alteration, a mixed effects logistic regression model was used. The change in methylation between non-diseased tissues and their tumor counterparts was significantly greater in single compared to bidirectional promoters across all 14 cancer types examined. Similarly, the extent of copy number alteration was greater in single gene compared to bidirectional promoters for all 14 cancer types. Furthermore, among 10 cancer types with available simple somatic mutation data, bidirectional promoters were slightly more susceptible. These results suggest that selective pressures related with specific functional impacts during carcinogenesis drive the susceptibility of promoter regions to somatic alteration.\t\t\n",
      "(0.442)  Although they are critical to models of coordinated care, the relationship and communication between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer specialists throughout the cancer continuum are poorly understood. By using predefined search terms, the authors conducted a systematic review of the literature in 3 databases to examine the relationship and communication between PCPs and cancer specialists. Among 301 articles identified, 35 met all inclusion criteria and were reviewed in-depth. Findings from qualitative, quantitative, and disaggregated mixed-methods studies were integrated using meta-synthesis. Six themes were identified and incorporated into a preliminary conceptual model of the PCP-cancer specialist relationship: 1) poor and delayed communication between PCPs and cancer specialists, 2) cancer specialists' endorsement of a specialist-based model of care, 3) PCPs' belief that they play an important role in the cancer continuum, 4) PCPs' willingness to participate in the cancer continuum, 5) cancer specialists' and PCPs' uncertainty regarding the PCP's oncology knowledge/experience, and 6) discrepancies between PCPs and cancer specialists regarding roles. These data indicate a pervasive need for improved communication, delineation, and coordination of responsibilities between PCPs and cancer specialists. Future interventions aimed at these deficiencies may improve patient and physician satisfaction and cancer care coordination. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:156169. © 2016 American Cancer Society.\t\t\n",
      "(0.44)  Background: Uganda has one of the highest burdens of cervical cancer globally. In 2010 the Ugandan Ministry of Health launched the Strategic Plan for Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control with the hope of developing cervical cancer policy in Uganda. This study explored the beliefs of senior key informants in Uganda about cervical cancer prevention, the control programme, and the relevance of cervical cancer policy. Methods: We conducted 15 key informant interviews with participants from six organisations across Northern and Central Uganda. Participants were drawn from district local government health departments, St. Mary's Hospital Lacor, Uganda Nurses and Midwifery Council, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Ministry of Health in Kampala, Uganda. The interview recordings were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seven themes emerged relating to the cervical cancer prevention and control programmes in Uganda: (1) policy frameworks for cervical cancer, (2) operationalising cervical cancer prevention and control, (3) financial allocation and alignment, (4) human resources and capability, (5) essential supplies and vaccines, (6) administrative data and resource distribution, and (7) cervical cancer services. Conclusions: The key informants perceive that the lack of a cervical cancer policy in Uganda is hindering cervical cancer prevention and control programmes. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and stakeholders need to work together in coming up with an effective policy framework that will accelerate efforts towards cervical cancer prevention and control in Uganda. \n",

      "(0.624)  Background and Objective: To present a structured approach for assessing stakeholder perceptions and implementing the approach in guideline development. Methods: This work was carried out by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Equity and Stakeholder Engagement Project Groups through brainstorming and iterative frameworks, stakeholder engagement, pilot testing, refinement of ideas, using input from workshops, and discussions at GRADE Working Group meetings to produce this document, which constitutes a GRADE conceptual article on implementation. Results: We introduce the FACE implementation criteria, feasibility, acceptability, cost, and equity; priority; and intent to implement criterion. We outline the implementation importance of networks and approaches to patient and other stakeholder engagement. Implementation is often highly contextual and can benefit from stakeholder engagement and other assessments. Our FACE approach provides stakeholder questions and language to inform guideline implementation and tools. Conclusion: The FACE criteria propose a series of knowledge translation questions to guide the assessment of implementation for evidence-based guidelines. It is desirable for guideline developers to use a conceptual approach, such as FACE, to tailor implementation and inform end of guideline dissemination and knowledge translation activities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.57)  Background: Interventions that work must be effectively delivered at scale to achieve population level benefits. Researchers must choose among a vast array of implementation frameworks (> 60) that guide design and evaluation of implementation and scale-up processes. Therefore, we sought to recommend conceptual frameworks that can be used to design, inform, and evaluate implementation of physical activity (PA) and nutrition interventions at different stages of the program life cycle. We also sought to recommend a minimum data set of implementation outcome and determinant variables (indicators) as well as measures and tools deemed most relevant for PA and nutrition researchers. Methods: We adopted a five-round modified Delphi methodology. For rounds 1, 2, and 3 we administered online surveys to PA and nutrition implementation scientists to generate a rank order list of most commonly used; i) implementation and scale-up frameworks, ii) implementation indicators, and iii) implementation and scale-up measures and tools. Measures and tools were excluded after round 2 as input from participants was very limited. For rounds 4 and 5, we conducted two in-person meetings with an expert group to create a shortlist of implementation and scale-up frameworks, identify a minimum data set of indicators and to discuss application and relevance of frameworks and indicators to the field of PA and nutrition. Results: The two most commonly referenced implementation frameworks were the Framework for Effective Implementation and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We provide the 25 most highly ranked implementation indicators reported by those who participated in rounds 1-3 of the survey. From these, the expert group created a recommended minimum data set of implementation determinants (n = 10) and implementation outcomes (n = 5) and reconciled differences in commonly used terms and definitions. Conclusions: Researchers are confronted with myriad options when conducting implementation and scale-up evaluations. Thus, we identified and prioritized a list of frameworks and a minimum data set of indicators that have potential to improve the quality and consistency of evaluating implementation and scale-up of PA and nutrition interventions. Advancing our science is predicated upon increased efforts to develop a common 'language' and adaptable measures and tools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.545)  Background: Models, theories, and frameworks (MTFs) provide the foundation for a cumulative science of implementation, reflecting a shared, evolving understanding of various facets of implementation. One under-represented aspect in implementation MTFs is how intersecting social factors and systems of power and oppression can shape implementation. There is value in enhancing how MTFs in implementation research and practice account for these intersecting factors. Given the large number of MTFs, we sought to identify exemplar MTFs that represent key implementation phases within which to embed an intersectional perspective. Methods: We used a five-step process to prioritize MTFs for enhancement with an intersectional lens. We mapped 160 MTFs to three previously prioritized phases of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) framework. Next, 17 implementation researchers/practitioners, MTF experts, and intersectionality experts agreed on criteria for prioritizing MTFs within each KTA phase. The experts used a modified Delphi process to agree on an exemplar MTF for each of the three prioritized KTA framework phases. Finally, we reached consensus on the final MTFs and contacted the original MTF developers to confirm MTF versions and explore additional insights. Results: We agreed on three criteria when prioritizing MTFs: acceptability (mean = 3.20, SD = 0.75), applicability (mean = 3.82, SD = 0.72), and usability (median = 4.00, mean = 3.89, SD = 0.31) of the MTF. The top-rated MTFs were the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care for the Identify the problem phase (mean = 4.57, SD = 2.31), the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for the Assess barriers/facilitators to knowledge use phase (mean = 5.79, SD = 1.12), and the Behaviour Change Wheel for the Select, tailor, implement interventions phase (mean = 6.36, SD = 1.08). Conclusions: Our interdisciplinary team engaged in a rigorous process to reach consensus on MTFs reflecting specific phases of the implementation process and prioritized each to serve as an exemplar in which to embed intersectional approaches. The resulting MTFs correspond with specific phases of the KTA framework, which itself may be useful for those seeking particular MTFs for particular KTA phases. This approach also provides a template for how other implementation MTFs could be similarly considered in the future. Trial registration: Open Science Framework Registration: osf.io/qgh64.\t\t\n",
      "(0.537)  Background: Middle managers are given scant attention in the implementation literature in health care, where the focus is on senior leaders and frontline clinicians. Aims: To empirically examine the role of middle managers relevant to innovation implementation and how middle managers experience the implementation process. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using the methods of grounded theory. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with middle managers (N = 15) in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. Participants were purposively sampled, based on their involvement in implementation initiatives and to obtain variation in manager characteristics. Data were collected and analyzed concurrently, using an inductive constant comparative approach. Data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation was reached. Results: Middle managers see themselves as being responsible for making implementation happen in their programs and services. As a result, they carry out five roles related to implementation: planner, coordinator, facilitator, motivator, and evaluator. However, the data also revealed two determinants of middle managers' role in implementation, which they must negotiate to fulfill their specific implementation roles and activities: (1) They perform many other roles and responsibilities within their organizations, both clinical and managerial in nature, and (2) they have limited decision-making power with respect to implementation and must work within the parameters set by upper levels of the organization. Linking Evidence to Action: Middle managers play an important role in translating adoption decisions into on-the-ground implementation. Optimizing their capacity to fulfill this role may be key to improving innovation implementation in healthcare organizations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.536)  The impact of policy ambiguity on implementation is a perennial concern in policy circles. The degree of ambiguity of policy goals and the means to achieve them influences the likelihood that a policy will be uniformly understood and implemented across implementation sites. We argue that the application of institutional and organisational theories to policy implementation must be supplemented by a socio-cognitive lens in which stakeholders' interpretations of policy are investigated and compared. We borrow the concept of 'Shared Mental Models' from the literature on industrial psychology to examine the microprocesses of policy implementation. Drawing from interviews with 45 key informants involved in the implementation of a hospital funding reform, known as Quality-Based Procedures in Ontario, Canada, we identify divergent mental models and explain how these divergences may have affected implementation and change management. We close with considerations for future research and practice. \n",

      "(0.858)  Natural Killer (NK) cell responses to HIV-infected CD4 T cells (iCD4) depend on the integration of signals received through inhibitory (iNKR) and activating NK receptors (aNKR). iCD4 activate NK cells to inhibit HIV replication. HIV infection-dependent changes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands for iNKR on iCD4 are well documented. By contrast, less is known regarding the HIV infection related changes in ligands for aNKR on iCD4. We examined the aNKR ligand profiles HIV p24+ HIV iCD4s that maintained cell surface CD4 (iCD4+), did not maintain CD4 (iCD4-) and uninfected CD4 (unCD4) T cells for expression of unique long (UL)-16 binding proteins-1 (ULBP-1), ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1-related (MIC)-A, MIC-B, CD48, CD80, CD86, CD112, CD155, Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-A2, HLA-C, and the ligands to NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DS1 (KIR3DS1) by flow cytometry on CD4 T cells from 17 HIV-1 seronegative donors activated and infected with HIV. iCD4+ cells had higher expression of aNKR ligands than did unCD4. However, the expression of aNKR ligands on iCD4 where CD4 was downregulated (iCD4-) was similar to (ULBP-1, ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, MIC-A, CD48, CD80, CD86 and CD155) or significantly lower than (MIC-B, CD112 and ICAM-2) what was observed on unCD4. Thus, HIV infection can be associated with increased expression of aNKR ligands or either baseline or lower than baseline levels of aNKR ligands, concomitantly with the HIV-mediated downregulation of cell surface CD4 on infected cells.\t\t\n",
      "(0.651)  Objectives We evaluated the association between pre-ART HIV DNA and HIV-infected participant characteristics at baseline as well as with their response to first-line ART. Methods Four hundred and thirty-three patients from the ICONA cohort, starting first-line ART after the year 2000, were analysed. Pre-ART HIV DNA was quantified with the modified COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test and normalized by CD4+ T cells. Linear correlation between pre-ART HIV DNA and other continuous markers (HIV RNA, CD4 count, markers of inflammation and coagulation) at baseline was evaluated by means of Pearson correlation coefficient and a linear regression model. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were used to study the association between pre-ART HIV DNA and time to VIRO-immunoclinical events. Results Pre-ART HIV DNA [median (IQR): 10  702 (3397-36  632) copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells] was correlated with pre-ART HIV RNA [R 2 = +0.44, (P < 0.0001)], CD4+ T cells [R 2 = '0.58, (P < 0.0001)] and CD4/CD8 ratio [R 2 = '0.48, (P < 0.0001)], while weaker correlations were observed with CD8+ T cells (R 2 = '0.20, P = 0.01), IL-6 (R 2 = +0.16, P = 0.002) and soluble CD14 (R 2 = +0.09, P = 0.05). Patients with higher pre-ART HIV DNA showed lower rate and delayed VIROlogical response (defined as HIV RNA =50 copies/mL), compared with those having lower HIV DNA (67.2% for >10  000, 81.1% for 1000-10  000 and 86.4% for 10-1000 copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells; P = 0.0004). Higher pre-ART HIV DNA was also correlated with increased risk of VIROlogical rebound (defined as HIV RNA >50 copies/mL) by 24 months (17.2% for >10  000, 7.4% for 1000-10  000 and 4.3% for 10-1000 copies/10 6 CD4+ T cells; P = 0.0048). Adjusted HRs of all VIROlogical rebound definitions confirmed these findings (P = 0.02). Conclusions Pre-ART HIV DNA, along with HIV RNA and CD4+ T cell count, should be considered as a new staging marker to better identify people at lower (or higher) risk of viral rebound following achievement of VIROlogical suppression (=50 copies/mL).\t\t\n",
      "(0.638)  Public health messages shape how the world understands the HIV epidemic. Considerable inequalities remain in HIV care continuum indicators by subpopulation and geography (eg, highest infection and mortality burden among men who have sex with men and people who live in sub-Saharan Africa). Health equity-focused approaches are necessary in this next decade to close gaps in the HIV epidemic. Between 1981 and 1989, HIV messages triggered fear and victim blaming, and highlighted behaviours of a few marginalised groups as deviant. Between 1990 and 1999, messages signalled that HIV was a growing challenge for the world and required multisector approaches that addressed structural drivers of inequality. Between 2000 and 2009, messages highlighted universal testing, while advances in HIV testing made these messages easier for individuals to respond to than in previous decades. Currently, messages signal that ending HIV is possible, people can live productive lives with HIV, and transmission to people without HIV can be eliminated. Public health messaging about the HIV epidemic has evolved substantially over the past 40 years. Future HIV messaging should be driven by health equity principles that include an increased representation of key populations in message design and dissemination, transparency of funding, and communicating any impact that campaigns have had on closing health inequalities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.615)  Background: Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) face an increased burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Repeated pulmonary infections, antibiotic exposures, and immunosuppression may contribute to an altered small airway epithelium (SAE) microbiome. Methods: SAE cells were collected from 28 PLWH and 48 HIV- controls through bronchoscopic cytologic brushings. DNA extracted from SAE cells was subjected to 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. Comparisons of alpha and beta diversity between HIV+ and HIV- groups were performed and key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) distinguishing the two groups were identified using the Boruta feature selection after Random Forest Analysis. Results: PLWH demonstrated significantly reduced Shannon diversity compared with HIV- volunteers (1.82±0.10 vs. 2.20±0.073, p=0.0024). This was primarily driven by a reduction in bacterial richness (23.29±2.75 for PLWH and 46.04±3.716 for HIV-, p<0.0001). Phyla distribution was significantly altered among PLWH, with an increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p=0.0003) and a decrease in Bacteroidetes (p=0.0068) and Firmicutes (p=0.0002). Six discriminative OTUs were found to distinguish PLWH from HIV- volunteers, aligning to Veillonellaceae, Fusobacterium, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Campylobacter. Conclusions: Compared to HIV- controls, PLWH's SAE microbiome is marked by reduced bacterial diversity and richness with significant differences in community composition.\t\t\n",
      "(0.589)  Objectives: Viral phylogenetics revealed two patterns of HIV-1 spread among MSM in Quebec. While most HIV-1 strains (n = 2011) were associated with singleton/small clusters (cluster size 1-4), 30 viral lineages formed large networks (cluster size 20-140), contributing to 42% of diagnoses between 2011 and 2015. Herein, tissue culture selections ascertained if large cluster lineages possessed higher replicative fitness than singleton/small cluster isolates, allowing for viral escape from integrase inhibitors.Methods: Primary HIV-1 isolates from large 20+ cluster (n = 11) or singleton/small cluster (n = 6) networks were passaged in vitro in escalating concentrations of dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine for 24-36 weeks. Sanger and deep sequencing assessed genotypic changes under selective drug pressure.Results: Large cluster HIV-1 isolates selected for resistance to dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine faster than HIV-1 strains forming small clusters. With dolutegravir, large cluster HIV-1 variants acquired solitary R263K (n = 7), S153Y (n = 1) or H51Y (n = 1) mutations as the dominant quasi-species within 8-12 weeks as compared with small cluster lineages where R263K (n = 1/6), S153Y (1/6) or WT species (4/6) were observed after 24 weeks. Interestingly, dolutegravir-associated mutations compromised viral replicative fitness, precluding escalations in concentrations beyond 5-10 nM. With elvitegravir, large cluster variants more rapidly acquired first mutations (T66I, A92G, N155H or S147G) by week 8 followed by sequential accumulation of multiple mutations leading to viral escape (>10 µM) by week 24.Conclusions: Further studies are needed to understand virological features of large cluster viruses that may favour their transmissibility, replicative competence and potential to escape selective antiretroviral drug pressure. \n",

      "(0.457)  Background: Evidence-Based Medicine is built on the premise that clinicians can be more confident when their decisions are grounded in high-quality evidence. Furthermore, evidence from studies involving patient-oriented outcomes is preferred when making decisions about tests or treatments. Ideally, the findings of relevant and valid trials should be stable over time, that is, unlikely to be reversed in subsequent research. Objective: To evaluate the stability of evidence from trials relevant to primary healthcare and to identify study characteristics associated with their reversal. Methods: We studied synopses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from 2002 to 2005 as \"Daily POEMs\"(Patient Oriented Evidence that Matters). The initial evidence (E1) from these POEMs (2002-2005) was compared with the updated evidence (E2) on that same topic in a summary resource (DynaMed 2019). Two physician-raters independently categorized each POEM-RCT as (i) reversed when E1 = E2, or as (ii) not reversed, when E1 = E2. For all \"Evidence Reversals\"(E1 = E2), we assessed the direction of change in the evidence. Results: We evaluated 408 POEMs on RCTs. Of those, 35 (9%; 95% confidence interval [6-12]) were identified as reversed, 359 (88%) were identified as not reversed, and 14 (3%) were indeterminate. On average, this represents about 2 evidence reversals per annum for POEMs about RCTs. Conclusions: Over 12-17 years, 9% of RCTs summarized as POEMs are reversed. Information alerting services that apply strict criteria for relevance and validity of clinical information are likely to identify RCTs whose findings are stable over time.\t\t\n",
      "(0.449)  Introduction: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues Insufficient Evidence (I) statements when scientific evidence is inadequate for making recommendations about clinical preventive services. Insufficient Evidence statements may be changed to definitive recommendations if new research closes evidence gaps. This study examines the characteristics of evidence that informed changes from I statements to definitive recommendations, including NIH's role as a funder. Methods: A total of 11 USPSTF Insufficient Evidence statements that were changed between 2010 and 2019 were assessed. Study designs, bibliometric influence, and funding sources for scientific articles cited in USPSTF evidence reviews were characterized for each I statement. Data were analyzed in 20192020. Results: Most I statements (82%) changed to a B grade; an average of 8.4 years elapsed between issuing the I statement and releasing the definitive recommendation. An average of 63 (range=19-253) articles were included in each USPSTF evidence review. NIH support was cited in 28.8% of articles, on average. The proportion of NIH-funded articles reporting RCT designs was similar to that of nonNIH-funded articles (64.5% vs 59.5%). A higher proportion of NIH-funded articles were rated good quality for study design (39.0%) than the proportion of nonNIH-funded articles (24.4%). Bibliometric influence measured by relative citation ratios was higher for NIH-funded (mean=14.78) than for nonNIH-funded (mean=5.07) articles. Conclusions: Study designs and funding supports varied widely across topics, but overall, NIH was the largest single funder of evidence informing 11 changed USPSTF I statements. Enhanced efforts by NIH and other stakeholders to address I statement evidence gaps are needed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.422)  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about clinical preventive services. The USPSTF examines chains of direct and indirect evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of a clinical preventive service. Missing links across the chains of evidence reflect gaps in the research. Evidence gaps can occur for preventive services that receive a letter grade recommendation and those that receive an I statement (insufficient evidence). This article describes the types of evidence gaps that the USPSTF encounters across its various recommendations and how the USPSTF identifies and communicates these gaps to researchers and policymakers, who can help generate the needed evidence. Common types of evidence gaps include limited evidence in primary care settings and populations, a lack of appropriate health outcomes, limited evidence linking behavior change to health outcomes, and a lack of evidence for effective preventive services in diverse populations. The USPSTF annual report to Congress focuses on the evidence gaps of new recommendations from the past year and is sent to leading research funding agencies. The Office of Disease Prevention at NIH uses this report to help direct future funding opportunities that may address these evidence gaps. The USPSTF plays a critical role in highlighting the information needed to advance the science to optimize the use of clinical preventive services in primary care.\t\t\n",
      "(0.406)  Background: In Canada, cost prohibits access to emergency contraception (EC) which may assist to prevent unintended pregnancy. The drug, ulipristal acetate (UPA-EC), is more clinically effective and cost-effective than the prior standard levonorgestrel (LNG-EC). We analyzed provincial EC subsidization policies and examined underlying decision-making processes. Methods: We undertook documentary analysis of provincial EC subsidization policies in publicly available drug formularies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants to explore the processes underlying current policies. Results: Quebec is the only province to subsidize UPA-EC, whilst all ten provinces subsidize LNG-EC. As such, provincial EC subsidization policies do not align with the latest UPA-EC evidence. Interviews revealed that evidence was valued in the policymaking process and formulary decisions were made through interdisciplinary consensus. Conclusions: We identify a gap between EC subsidization policies and the latest evidence. Institutional structures affect policies reflecting evolving evidence. Increasing interdisciplinary mechanisms may encourage evidence-based policies.\t\t\n",
      "(0.4)  Background: Health systems worldwide struggle to identify, adopt, and implement in a timely and system-wide manner the best-evidence-informed-policy-level practices. Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network's \"absorptive capacity\" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework. Methods: The project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network's and subnetwork's effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes. Discussion: Knowledge developed from this project has the potential both to strengthen the scientific understanding of how policy-level knowledge transfer and exchange functions and to provide significantly improved advice on how to ensure evidence plays a more prominent role in public policies. \n",

It is unknown whether BCPR delivery disparities exist based on victim gender. We measured BCPR rates by gender in private and public environments, hypothesizing that females would be less likely than males to receive BCPR in public settings, with an associated difference in survival to hospital discharge. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from adult, nontraumatic OHCA events within the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium registry (2011-2015). Using logistic regression, we modeled the likelihood of receiving BCPR by gender, including patient-level variables, stratified by location. A cohort of 19<U+2009>331 OHCAs was assessed. Mean age was 64±17 years, and 63% (12<U+2009>225/19<U+2009>331) were male. Overall, 37% of OHCA victims received bystander CPR. In public locations, 39% (272/694) of females and 45% (1170/2600) of males received BCPR ( P<0.01), whereas in private settings, 35% (2198/6328) of females and 36% (3364/9449) of males received BCPR ( P=NS). Among public OHCAs, males had significantly increased odds of receiving BCPR compared with females (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53; P=0.01); this was not the case in the private setting (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-1.01; P=NS). Controlling for site, age, and race, BCPR was significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.54-1.85; P<0.01); in this model, males had 29% increased odds of survival compared with females (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Males had an increased likelihood of receiving BCPR compared with females in public. BCPR improved survival to discharge, with greater survival among males compared with females.\t\t\n",

We conducted a matched case-control study using administrative databases to evaluate the association between the rate of infections and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2-14 years from Ontario, Canada and we used a validated approach to measure infections. In 1600 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 16 000 matched cancer-free controls aged 2-14 years, having >2 infections/year increased the odds of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 43% (odds ratio = 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.81) compared to children with =0.25 infections/year. Having >2 respiratory infections/year increased odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 28% (odds ratio =1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.57) compared to children with =0.25 respiratory infections/year. Having an invasive infection increased the odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 72% (odds ratio =1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31-2.26). Having an infection between the age of 1-1.5 years increased the odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by 20% (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.39). Having more infections increased the odds of developing childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and having an infection between the ages of 1-1.5 years increased the odds of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\t\t\n",
      "(0.428)  Purpose: To examine the association betweenantineoplastic drug (AD) handling and risk of miscarriage. Methods: Nurses Health Study-3 participants self-reported AD administration and engineering controls (ECs) and personal protective equipment (PPE) use at baseline. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of miscarriage in relation to baseline AD handling using multivariable Cox proportional regression. Results: Overall, 2440 nurses reported 3327 pregnancies, with 550 (17%) ended in miscarriages. Twelve percent of nurses self-reported currently handling AD and 28% previously handling AD. Compared with nurses who never handled AD, nurses who handled AD at baseline had an adjusted HR of miscarriage of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.971.64). This association was stronger after 12-weeks gestation (HR=2.39 [95% CI, 1.135.07]). Nurses who did not always use gloves had HR of 1.51 (95% CI, 0.912.51) compared with 1.19 (95% CI, 0.891.60) for those always using gloves; nurses who did not always use gowns had HR of 1.32 (95% CI, 0.951.83) compared with 1.19 (95% CI, 0.811.75) for nurses always using gowns. Conclusions: We observed a suggestive association between AD handling and miscarriage, particularly among nurses who did not consistently use PPE and EC with stronger associations for second trimester losses.\t\t\n",
      "(0.399)  Swimmers have a high prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which may be associated with repeated exposure to chlorinated pool water. The eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) test is used to diagnose EIB; however, it fails to replicate the environmental conditions experienced by swimmers. The relationship between the composition of the EVH inspired gas and the development of EIB from swim exercise remains unclear. Purpose This study aimed to compare the bronchoconstrictive effect of a chlorinated inspirate EVH test and swim test to a laboratory-based EVH test in swimmers. Methods Fifteen collegiate swimmers (n = 5 male, n = 10 female; 21 ± 2 yr) completed 3 d of testing in pseudorandom order; a standard EVH test (EVHL), a pool air EVH test (EVHCl), and a swimming test (Swim). Spirometry was measured at baseline, and 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after each test. Results EVHL elicited a forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) fall index of -9.7% ± 6.4% compared with -6.6% ± 9.2% and -3.0% ± 7.5% after EVHCl and Swim, respectively (P < 0.05). Using Bland-Altman analysis, we found good agreement between EVHL and EVHCl (bias = -2.8, r = 0.79; P < 0.05) with poor agreement between EVHL and Swim (bias = -6.7, r = 0.20) and between EVHCl and Swim (bias = -3.9, r = 0.50; both P < 0.05). Forced expired flow between 25% and 75% lung volume and peak expired flow were significantly reduced by the EVHL compared with the EVHCl and Swim tests (P < 0.05). Conclusions EVHL elicits a greater forced expired volume in 1-s fall index compared with EVHCl and Swim. The unique aquatic environment of swimmers potentially protects against bronchoconstriction and should be considered in the determination of EIB.\t\t\n",
      "(0.385)  Background: Patients with metastatic prostate cancer have poor prognosis. In this study, we compared the addition of abiraterone, docetaxel, bisphosphonate, celecoxib or combinations to standard ADT vs. ADT alone for patients with mHSPC in terms of overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS), and adverse events. Methods: We searched PubMed and performed a network meta-analysis to generate probabilistic inferences and provide efficacy rankings in terms of posterior hazard ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI), surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), probability better than competing treatments, and probability best. Results: Seven trials were included (LATITUTE, STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15, ZAPCA, CALGB 90202, and MRC PR05). Compared to ADT alone, evidence suggests abiraterone + ADT (OS HR: 0.60; 95% CrI: 0.500.71, FFS HR: 0.31; 95% CrI: 0.250.38) could be superior in terms of OS and FFS compared to docetaxel + ADT (OS 0.74; 95% CrI: 0.630.86, FFS 0.62; 95% CrI: 0.530.74), bisphosphonate + ADT (OS: 0.87; 95% CrI: 0.751.00, FFS 0.87; 95% CrI: 0.751.00), celecoxib + ADT (OS: 0.91; 95% CrI: 0.711.17, FFS: 0.86; 95% CrI: 0.681.08), or triple combinations. Abiraterone + ADT suggests improved survival with 97% certainty for a 19% reduction in risk of death compared to docetaxel + ADT (HR: 0.81; 95% CrI: 0.661.00). Discussion: Addition of abiraterone to standard ADT may possibly outperform the addition of docetaxel, bisphosphonates, celecoxib, or combinations to standard ADT in terms of OS and FFS. \n",

      "(0.58)  Social media data have provoked a mixed response from researchers. While there is great enthusiasm for this new source of social data  Twitter data in particular  concerns are also expressed about their biases and unknown provenance and, consequently, their credibility for social research. This article seeks a middle path, arguing that we must develop better understanding of the construction and circulation of social media data to evaluate their appropriate uses and the claims that might be made from them. Building on sociotechnical approaches, we propose a high-level abstraction of the pipeline through which social media data are constructed and circulated. In turn, we explore how this shapes the populations and samples that are present in social media data and the methods that generate data about them. We conclude with some broad principles for supporting methodologically informed social media research in the future.\t\t\n",
      "(0.569)  Social distancing is an important public health recommendation that has been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Infections are rising among younger populations, but relatively little is known about youth social distancing behavior. Our qualitative study aims to examine youth engagement with social distancing and elucidate the reasons why guidelines are followed and broken. Members of the national MyVoice Text Message Cohort (aged 1424) were surveyed from April 24 to April 30, 2020, through an open-ended text message poll. Responses were inductively coded and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Of the 944 youth who responded (response rate = 81.2%), 95% self-reported social distancing. However, 62% recalled instances of themselves or others breaking the guidelines and 19% expressed misconceptions about the rules. Notably, 14% of youth said they would encourage their friends to social distance by telling them it will accelerate a return to normal life. Feelings of social isolation were the most frequently cited (55%) negative impact of social distancing. Overall, responses from youth indicate significant variation in the interpretation of social distancing guidelines. Public health communications may need to address several critical misconceptions which impact the social distancing behaviors of youth. Further, safe methods for youth to interact with peers during periods of social distancing are necessary to prevent mental health impacts and to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines.\t\t\n",
      "(0.5)  As donor financial support decreases, ending the HIV epidemic in Asia will require novel and sustainable approaches. Social innovation, a community-engaged process that links social change and health improvement, may be useful for helping to end the HIV epidemic in Asia. A scoping review to examine social innovation strategies in sexual health for the Asian region was conducted. The research identified focused on three types of social innovation: (1) microfinance; (2) social entrepreneurship; and (3) social enterprise. Microfinance provides financial opportunities (e.g. banking services, job opportunities) to spur local entrepreneurship and healthier behaviours. Social entrepreneurship uses business principles and tools (e.g. crowdsourcing, human-centred design) to improve health. Social enterprise is a business with a social mission. Further research is needed to measure the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of social innovation strategies in improving HIV services.\t\t\n",
      "(0.494)  Physical distancing practices during the COVID-19 global pandemic contributed to a high degree of social isolation among older adults. To reduce loneliness and other ill effects of social isolation, public health experts recommended outdoor social gathering, with physical distancing. Adopting a case study approach, we explored how social aspects of group outdoor health walks (GOHWs) mitigate social isolation for older adults and improve individual social wellbeing. We used semi-structured interviews to understand the experiences of social isolation and social relationships in nine older (5080 s) adults participating in a GOHW in Scotland, United Kingdom (UK). Verbatim transcripts were analysed through an iterative process of thematic analysis carried out by an interdisciplinary team of qualitative researchers from environmental psychology, medicine, and geography. Themes provide insight into the social dimensions of GOHWs, the mediating effects of social experiences, and the contribution these make to individual social wellbeing. GOHWs provide opportunities to be part of a group and attend to the needs of inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Being part of the group walk fosters casual interpersonal interactions through spontaneous mixing during and after the walk. This programmatic structure counters loneliness, en-genders pleasurable anticipation of regular contact with others, supports physical activity, and fosters group cohesion. These in turn contribute to individual social wellbeing, including expanding social networks, meaningful relationships, a sense of belonging, and acting on empathy for others. GOWHs may be beneficial for mitigation of social isolation as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings were used to propose a conceptual model to parse social constructs and inform selection or development of quantitative social measures for future studies of nature-based interventions such as GOHWs.\t\t\n",

      "(0.498)  Introduction: Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are likely to be offered only to patients with molecular evidence for Alzheimer pathology and expanded to patients with prodromal AD. We calculated the potential future costs of expanding the number of positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in the United Kingdom. Methods: We conducted a focused literature review and consulted experts to obtain information on the current use of PET and CSF to diagnose prodromal AD, staffing and equipment requirements for these tests, and associated costs. Results: We estimate annual costs of 100,000 extra amyloid PET scans and 100,000 extra CSF tests at £113 million and £48 million, respectively; these costs are likely to be higher in the first year. Discussion: The budgetary impacts are not insignificant but are small in comparison to the likely market price of any disease-modifying treatments or to the probable costs of missed or inaccurate diagnosis.\t\t\n",
      "(0.465)  Purpose: To estimate the direct and indirect costs of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the first and second years of initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD), hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) and nocturnal home HD. Methods: A cost analysis was performed to estimate the annual costs of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD for ESRD patients from both the health service provider's and societal perspectives. Empirical data on healthcare resource use, patients' out-of-pocket costs, time spent on transportation and dialysis by ESRD patients and time spent by caregivers were analysed. All costs were expressed in Hong Kong year 2017 dollars. Results: Analysis was based on 402 ESRD patients on maintenance dialysis (PD: 189; hospital-based HD: 170; and nocturnal home HD: 43). From the perspective of the healthcare provider, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual direct medical costs in the initial year (mean ± SD) (hospital-based HD = $400 057 ± 62 822; PD = $118 467 ± 15 559; nocturnal home HD = $223 358 ± 18 055; P < 0.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $360 924 ± 63 014; PD = $80 796 ± 15 820; nocturnal home HD = $87 028 ± 9059; P < 0.001). From the societal perspective, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual costs in the initial year (hospital-based HD = $452 151 ± 73 327; PD = $189 191 ± 61 735; nocturnal home HD = $242 038 ± 28 281; P < 0.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $413 017 ± 73 501; PD = $151 520 ± 60 353; nocturnal home HD = $105 708 ± 23 853; P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study quantified the economic burden of ESRD patients, and assessed the annual healthcare and societal costs in the initial and second years of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD in Hong Kong. From both perspectives, PD is cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD, except that nocturnal home HD has the lowest cost in the second year of treatment from the societal perspective. Results from this cost analysis facilitate economic evaluation in Hong Kong for health services and management targeted at ESRD patients.\t\t\n",
      "(0.46)  To determine incidence-based healthcare costs attributable to nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease (PD) and NTM pulmonary isolation (PI), from the healthcare payer perspective, we conducted a population- based matched cohort study in Ontario, Canada. We established cohorts of patients with incident NTMPD and NTM-PI during 2001-2012 by using individually linked laboratory data and health administrative data, matched to unexposed persons from the general population. To estimate attributable costs for acute and longterm illness, we used a phase-of-care approach. Costs were stratified by age, sex, and healthcare resource, and reported in 2018 Canadian dollars (CAD) and US dollars (USD), standardized to 10 days. Costs were highest during the before-death phase (NTM-PD CAD $1,352 [USD $1,044]; NTM-PI CAD $731 [USD $565]). The cumulative mean attributable 1-year costs were CAD $14,953 (USD $11,541) for NTM-PD and CAD $8,729 (USD $6,737) for NTM-PI. Costs for patients with NTM-PD and NTM-PI were higher than those for unexposed persons.\t\t\n",
      "(0.435)  Objective To determine 1-year attributable healthcare costs of bronchiolitis. Methods Using a population-based matched cohort and incidence-based cost analysis approach, we identified infants <12 months old diagnosed in an emergency department (ED) or hospitalized with bronchiolitis between April 1, 2003 and March 31, 2014. We propensity-score matched infants with and without bronchiolitis on sex, age, income quintile, rurality, co-morbidities, gestational weeks, small-for-gestational-age status and pre-index healthcare cost deciles. We calculated mean attributable 1-year costs using a generalized estimating equation model and stratified costs by age, sex, income quintile, rurality, co-morbidities and prematurity. Results We identified 58,375 infants with bronchiolitis (mean age 154±95 days, 61.3% males, 4.2% with comorbidities). Total 1-year mean bronchiolitis-attributable costs were $4,313 per patient (95%CI: $4,1484,477), with $2,847 (95%CI: $2,7122,982) spent on hospitalizations, $610 (95%CI: $594627) on physician services, $562 (95%CI: $556567)] on ED visits, $259 (95%CI: $222297) on other healthcare costs and $35 ($2742) on drugs. Attributable bronchiolitis costs were $2,765 (95%CI: $27352,794) vs $111 (95%CI: $102121) in the initial 10 days post index date, $4,695 (95%CI: $4,5894,800) vs $910 (95%CI: $847973) in the initial 180 days and $1,158 (95%CI: $1,1041213) vs $639 (95%CI: $599679) during days 181360. Mean 1-year bronchiolitis costs were higher in infants <3 months old [$5,536 (95%CI: $5,2165,856)], those with co-morbidities [$17,530 (95%CI: $14,68320,377)] and with low birthweight [$5,509 (95%CI: $4,9276,091)]. Conclusions Compared to no bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis incurs five-time and two-time higher healthcare costs within the initial and subsequent six-months, respectively. Most expenses occur in the initial 10 days and relate to hospitalization.\t\t\n",
      "(0.427)  Purpose: To compare the yearly cost involved per patient in the use of magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) and traditional growing rods (TGRs) in the treatment of early onset scoliosis (EOS) and to assess the overall cost burden of MCGR with reference to patient and health-care infrastructure. Methods: For a hypothetical case of a 5-year-old girl with a diagnosis of EOS, a decision-tree model using TreeAge Software was developed to simulate annual health state transitions and compare the 8-year accumulative direct, indirect, and total cost among the four groups: (1) dual MCGRs with exchange every 2 years, (2) dual MCGRs with exchange every 3 years, (3) TGR with surgical distraction every year, and (4) TGR with surgical distraction every 6 months. Base-case values and ranges of clinical parameters reflecting complication rate after each type of surgical distraction were determined from a review of literature and expert opinion. Government gazette and expert opinion provided cost estimation of growing rods, surgeries, surgical complications, and routine follow-up. Microsimulation of 1000 individuals was conducted to test the variation in total direct costs (in 2016 Hong Kong dollars (HKD)) between individuals, and estimated the standard deviations of total direct costs for each group. Results: Over the projected treatment period, indirect costs incurred by patients and family were higher for the MCGR as compared to the TGR. However, the total costs incurred by MCGR groups (group 1: HKD164k; group 2: HKD138k) were lower than those incurred by TGR groups (group 3: HKD191k; group 4: HKD290k). Although the accumulative costs of three groups (TGR with distraction every year and MCGR replacing every 2 and 3 years) were approaching each other in the first 2 years after initial implantation, at year 3 the accumulative cost of MCGR exchange every 2 years was HKD36k more than the yearly TGR surgery due to the cost of implant exchange. The cost incurred by both the MCGR groups was less than that incurred by the TGR groups from year 4 to skeletal maturity. Conclusions: The use of dual MCGRs, regardless of its 2-or 3-year exchange, was only cost saving and less expensive than the dual TGRs for EOS treatment from the fourth year of continuous treatment. Despite higher patient-related costs during MCGR treatment, it is important to consider the reduced risks and mental burden suffered by these children during repeat surgeries. With improved knowledge of the costs associated with long-term MCGR use, better constructed cost-effectiveness studies can be performed in the future. \n",

      "(0.571)  Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour  whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions  education, regulation and material incentivisation  largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context-dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.508)  Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a countrys health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions. Results Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 8095) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 9097), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 8493). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen. Conclusion Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.444)  Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are common yet preventable. Healthcare professional behaviours, such as reducing unnecessary catheter use, are key for preventing CAUTI. Previous research has focused on identifying gaps in the national response to CAUTI in multiple settings in England. This study aimed to identify how national interventions could be optimised. We conducted a multi-method study comprising: a rapid review of research on interventions to reduce CAUTI; a behavioural analysis of effective research interventions compared to national interventions; and a stakeholder focus group and survey to identify the most promising options for optimising interventions. We identified 37 effective research interventions, mostly conducted in United States secondary care. A behavioural analysis of these interventions identified 39 intervention components as possible ways to optimise national interventions. Seven intervention components were prioritised by stakeholders. These included: checklists for discharge/admission to wards; information for patients and relatives about the pros/cons of catheters; setting and profession specific guidelines; standardised nationwide computer-based documentation; promotion of alternatives to catheter use; CAUTI champions; and bladder scanners. By combining research evidence, behavioural analysis and stakeholder feedback, we identified how national interventions to reduce CAUTI could be improved. The seven prioritised components should be considered for future implementation.\t\t\n",
      "(0.435)  Background: Herd immunity, or community immunity, occurs when susceptible people in a population are indirectly protected from infection thanks to the pervasiveness of immunity within the population. In this study, we aimed to systematically review interventions designed to communicate what community immunity is and how community immunity works to members of the general public. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles describing interventions with or without evaluations. We then conducted web searches with Google to identify interventions lacking associated publications. We extracted data about the target population of the interventions, the interventions themselves (e.g., did they describe what community immunity is, and how it works), any effects of evaluated interventions, and synthesized data narratively. Results: We identified 32 interventions: 11 interventions described in peer-reviewed articles and 21 interventions without associated articles. Of the 32 interventions, 5 described what community immunity is, 6 described the mechanisms of how community immunity occurs and 21 described both. Fourteen of the 32 addressed infectious diseases in general while the other 13 addressed one or more specific diseases. Twelve of the 32 interventions used videos, 7 used interactive simulations and 6 used questionnaires. Ten of the 11 peer-reviewed articles described studies evaluating at least one effect of the interventions. Within these 10, 4/4 reported increased knowledge, 3/5 reported shifts of attitudes in favour of vaccination, 2/5 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Of 3 studies evaluating interventions specifically about community immunity, 2 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Conclusions: A compelling benefit of vaccination exists at the population level in the form of community immunity. Identifying ways to optimally communicate about this benefit may be important, because some evidence suggests that effective communication about community immunity can increase vaccination intentions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.427)  Group-based interventions are widely used to promote health-related behaviour change. While processes operating in groups have been extensively described, it remains unclear how behaviour change is generated in group-based health-related behaviour-change interventions. Understanding how such interventions facilitate change is important to guide intervention design and process evaluations. We employed a mixed-methods approach to identify, map and define change processes operating in group-based behaviour-change interventions. We reviewed multidisciplinary literature on group dynamics, taxonomies of change technique categories, and measures of group processes. Using weight-loss groups as an exemplar, we also reviewed qualitative studies of participants experiences and coded transcripts of 38 group sessions from three weight-loss interventions. Finally, we consulted group participants, facilitators and researchers about our developing synthesis of findings. The resulting Mechanisms of Action in Group-based Interventions (MAGI) framework comprises six overarching categories: (1) group intervention design features, (2) facilitation techniques, (3) group dynamic and development processes, (4) inter-personal change processes, (5) selective intra-personal change processes operating in groups, and (6) contextual influences. The framework provides theoretical explanations of how change occurs in group-based behaviour-change interventions and can be applied to optimise their design and delivery, and to guide evaluation, facilitator training and further research. \n",

      "(0.56)  Despite experiencing hot weathers, limited studies from India explored relationships between ambient heat and health. We studied associations between heat and all-cause mortality to estimate heat threshold(s) affecting health, and examine other affecting dimensions. We conducted time-series analysis with daily maximum temperature and all-cause mortality data of Bhubaneswar city (MarchJuly, 20072017), and explored their interactions. Mortality risks rose when daily maximum temperatures were >36.2°C (lower threshold), and even more when >40.5°C (upper threshold). Every degree above36.2°C increased the mortality risk by 2% (mortality rate ratio: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01, 1.03). The effects of maximum temperature increased on days when minimum temperatures were >25.6°C (median). The effect of heat was immediate and lasted for 01 day with no lagged effect. Two temperature thresholds with varying mortality risks provided an opportunity for a graded heat warning system. The accentuation of the deleterious effects of heat by the higher minimum temperature calls for its inclusion in the heat warning system in future.\t\t\n",
      "(0.556)  This study aimed to determine whether higher intakes of sodium, added sugars and saturated fat are prospectively associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality in a diverse population. The nationally-representative Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-Nutrition 2004 was linked with the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database and the Discharge Abstract Database (2004-2011). Outcomes were all-cause mortality and CVD incidence and mortality. There were 1,722 mortality cases within 115,566 person-years of follow-up (median (IQR) of 7.48 (7.22-7.70) years). There was no statistically significant association between sodium density or energy from saturated fat and all-cause mortality or CVD events for all models investigated. The association of usual percentage of energy from added sugars and all-cause mortality was significant in the base model with participants consuming 11.47% of energy from added sugars having 1.34 (95% CI: 1.01-1.77) times higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to those consuming 4.17% of energy from added sugars. Overall, our results did not find statistically significant associations between the three nutrients and risk of all-cause mortality or CVD events at the population level in Canada. Large-scale linked national nutrition datasets may not have the discrimination to identify prospective impacts of nutrients on health measures.\t\t\n",
      "(0.515)  What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks? Background: Following a century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking. Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images. Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing ~68.9% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors. Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age. Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.473)  Background and Purpose: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent epidemiological data on incidence, mortality, and association with oral anticoagulation are needed. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients (=18 years) with ICH in the entire population of Ontario, Canada (April 1, 2009-March 30, 2019). We captured outcome data using linked health administrative databases. The primary outcome was mortality during hospitalization, as well as at 1 year following ICH. Results: We included 20 738 patients with ICH. Mean (SD) age was 71.3 (15.1) years, and 52.6% of patients were male. Overall incidence of ICH throughout the study period was 19.1/100 000 person-years and did not markedly change over the study period. In-hospital and 1-year mortality were high (32.4% and 45.4%, respectively). Mortality at 2 years was 49.5%. Only 14.5% of patients were discharged home independently. Over the study period, both in-hospital and 1-year mortality reduced by 10.4% (37.5% to 27.1%, P<0.001) and 7.6% (50.0% to 42.4%, P<0.001), respectively. Use of oral anticoagulation was associated with both in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI, 1.26-1.49]) and 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.25]) following ICH. Conclusions: Both short- A nd long-term mortality have decreased in the past decade. Most survivors from ICH are likely to be discharged to long-term care. Oral anticoagulation is associated with both short- A nd long-term mortality following ICH. These findings highlight the devastating nature of ICH, but also identify significant improvement in outcomes over time.\t\t\n",
      "(0.445)  Background: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are associated with increased mortality relative to the general population. There is an international emphasis on decreasing this excess mortality. Aims: To determine whether the mortality gap between individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and the general population has decreased. Method: A nationally representative cohort study using primary care electronic health records from 2000 to 2014, comparing all patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and the general population. The primary outcome was allcause mortality. Results: Individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had elevated mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.79, 95% CI 1.67-1.88 and 2.08, 95% CI 1.98-2.19 respectively). Adjusted HRs for bipolar disorder increased by 0.14/year (95% CI 0.10-0.19) from 2006 to 2014. The adjusted HRs for schizophrenia increased gradually from 2004 to 2010 (0.11/year, 95% CI 0.04-0.17) and rapidly after 2010 (0.34/year, 95% CI 0.18-0.49). Conclusions: The mortality gap between individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and the general population is widening. \n",

      "(0.675)  In South Africa, economic liberalization and the technological innovations in the mining sector have altered employment opportunities for rural Xhosa. Young men struggle to find jobs as labor migrants, while some young women find work in villages. These women assume provider roles for their families that are reminiscent of longstanding normative masculine achievements. They also use their income to achieve relative independence. Although many households depend on working women, they nevertheless attract criticism. Women mobilize a discourse of human rights to defend their position in these conflicts, even as men argue that human rights enable womens wayward behaviour. Drawing on fieldwork in the Eastern Cape, this article argues that working women provoke controversy because of how they trouble gendered meanings attached to work, domesticity, and social reproduction. I show that although they challenge the patriarchal domestic order through lifestyle choices and overt appeals to the right to remain single, the strategies that working women deploy to manage conflicting expectations and a heavy workload also reproduce patriarchal domestic hierarchies. In so doing, they further exclude young men from social reproduction. By situating their struggle in a discursive framework of human rights, single women find ways of occupying seemingly contradictory positions simultaneously.\t\t\n",
      "(0.568)  Birth narratives have been found to provide women with the most accessible and often utilised means for giving voice to their exploration of meaning in their births. The stories women tell of their birth come out of their pre- and post-experience bodies, reproducing society through the sharing of cultural meanings. I recruited a selection of 20 birth stories from a popular mums Internet forum in the United Kingdom. Using structural and thematic analyses, I set out to explore how women tell the story of their body in childbirth. This project has contributed evidence to the discussion of womens experiences of subjectivity in the discursive landscape of birth, while uncovering previously unacknowledged sites of resistance. The linguistic restrictions, sustained by the neoliberal control mechanisms on society and the self, act to shape the reality, feelings, and expressions of birthing women. Naming these silencing strategies, as I have done through the findings of this project, and celebrating womens discourse on birth, as the explosion of birth stories across the Internet are doing, offer bold moves to challenge the muting status quo of women in birth. Reclaiming womens language for birth and working to create a new vocabulary encapsulating the experiences of birthing women will also present opportunities for the issue of birth and womens experiences of it to occupy greater political space with a confident and decisive voice.\t\t\n",
      "(0.525)  An equal number of women and men are now graduating from dental school, but women dentists have lower income and are less likely to achieve positions of leadership, including within dental academia. Materials and Methods: Demographic information and academic rank were obtained for all faculty at the eight dental schools who received the most funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2017. Years since dental school graduation, total number of PubMed-indexed citations, first- and last-author publications, and H-index were determined for each faculty member. Gender differences in productivity and advancement were evaluated. Results: Of 702 faculty members, 36.5% were female; only 24.4% of full professors were women. Men had significantly higher numbers of publications (30.2 [95% confidence interval [CI, 28.6-39.5] vs. 20.4 [95% CI 16.3-24.6], p = 0.02) and higher H-index (8.2 [95% CI 7.1-9.1] vs. 4.7 [95% CI 3.9-5.5], p < 0.0001). Women had graduated more recently than their male colleagues at all levels of academic advancement (overall 22.83 years [95% CI 21.29-24.39] vs. 30.19 years [95% CI 28.84-31.55], p < 0.0001). When corrected for academic productivity and years since graduation, the association between gender and academic rank was not significant. Conclusions: Women are underrepresented at each academic rank except instructor; however, women may advance more quickly than their male counterparts. Increasing scholarship and mentorship opportunities for female faculty members may help improve gender equity in dental academia.\t\t\n",
      "(0.491)  Background: Reproductive-aged women represent about half of those undergoing bariatric surgery in the United States. Obstetric and bariatric professional societies recommend that women avoid pregnancy for 12-18 months postoperatively due to concern for increased pregnancy risks, and that providers should counsel women about these recommendations and their contraceptive options. However, knowledge about women's experience with perioperative counseling and postoperative contraceptive use is limited. Objective: We sought to: (1) determine prevalence of perioperative contraceptive and pregnancy interval discussions among women who have recently undergone bariatric surgery; and (2) describe postoperative contraceptive use within the first year of surgery in this population. Study Design: We performed a cross-sectional study of US women, aged 18-45 years and recruited through Facebook, who underwent bariatric surgery within the last 24 months. Results: We enrolled 363 geographically diverse women. Three-quarters recalled perioperative pregnancy or contraceptive discussions, the majority with a bariatric provider. Half felt it was very important to discuss these issues perioperatively, and 41% of those who reported discussions wished they had had more. Of the 66% of women who reported using contraception in the first 12 months postoperatively, 27% used oral contraceptives and 26% used an intrauterine device. One third of contraceptive users who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a combined restrictive-malabsorptive procedure, were using oral contraceptives. Perioperative contraceptive or pregnancy discussions were independently associated with increased postoperative contraceptive use (odds ratios, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.54.3, P <.001). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of women who had undergone bariatric surgery reported having had no perioperative pregnancy or contraception counseling, and many women who had felt the discussions were insufficient. Those who had had perioperative discussions were more likely to use contraception postoperatively. Reproductive-aged women should be routinely counseled perioperatively about pregnancy and contraception in the context of their reproductive desires, so they can make informed decisions about perioperative pregnancy prevention and contraceptive method use.\t\t\n",
      "(0.46)  Background Female sterilization accounts for 50% of all contraceptive use in the U.S. The extent to which U.S. women with physical and/or sensory disabilities have undergone female sterilization is unknown. Objective Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of sterilization for women with physical/sensory disabilities, and compare this to the prevalence for women without disabilities. We also compared use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods between women with and without disabilities. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth 20112013, a population-based survey of U.S. women aged 1544. Bivariate comparisons between women with and without disabilities by female sterilization and LARC use were conducted using chi-square tests. Using logistic regression, we estimated the odds of female sterilization based upon disability status. Results Women with physical/sensory disabilities accounted for 9.3% of the total sample (N = 4966). Among women with disabilities only, 28.2% had undergone female sterilization, representing 1.2 million women nationally. LARC use was lower among women with disabilities than those without disabilities (5.4%, 9.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, insurance, marital status, parity, and self-reported health, women with disabilities had higher odds of sterilization (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03, 1.79). Conclusions The odds of female sterilization is higher among women with physical/sensory disabilities than those without disabilities. Future research is necessary to understand factors contributing to this finding, including possible underutilization of LARC methods. \n",

      "(0.546)  Objective Depression is a potential risk factor for developing IBD. This association may be related to GI symptoms occurring before diagnosis. We aimed to determine whether depression, adjusted for pre-existing GI symptoms, is associated with subsequent IBD. Design We conducted a nested case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink identifying incident cases of UC and Crohn's disease (CD) from 1998 to 2016. Controls without IBD were matched for age and sex. We measured exposure to prevalent depression 4.5-5.5 years before IBD diagnosis. We created two sub-groups with prevalent depression based on whether individuals had reported GI symptoms before the onset of depression. We used conditional logistic regression to derive ORs for the risk of IBD depending on depression status. Results We identified 10 829 UC cases, 4531 CD cases and 15 360 controls. There was an excess of prevalent depression 5 years before IBD diagnosis relative to controls (UC: 3.7% vs 2.7%, CD 3.7% vs 2.9%). Individuals with GI symptoms prior to the diagnosis of depression had increased adjusted risks of developing UC and CD compared with those without depression (UC: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.79; CD: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.92). Individuals with depression alone had similar risks of UC and CD to those without depression (UC: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; CD: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.38). Conclusions Depression, in the absence of prior GI symptoms, is not associated with subsequent development of IBD. However, depression with GI symptoms should prompt investigation for IBD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.502)  Aims: Reflux symptoms are highly prevalent and non-specific; hence, in the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy referral decisions are challenging. This study evaluated whether a non-endoscopic Cytosponge could detect benign oesophageal pathologies and thus have future potential in triaging patients with persistent symptoms. Methods and results: Two complementary cohorts were recruited: (i) patients with reflux symptoms and no prior endoscopy (n = 409), and (ii) patients with reflux symptoms referred for endoscopy (n = 411). All patients were investigated using the Cytosponge and endoscopy. Significant epithelial inflammation was present in 130 (16%) Cytosponge samples, 32 of which had ulcer slough. Candida and significant inflammation was detected in a further 22 (2.3%) cases; epithelial infiltration with >15 eosinophils/high-power field reflecting possible eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) in five (0.6%); and viral inclusions suggestive of herpes oesophagitis in one (0.1%). No significant pathology was detected in the majority, 662 (81%), of Cytosponge samples. Cytosponge and endoscopy findings were in agreement in 574 (70%) cases, in 165 (67%) of the discordant cases one investigation showed mild inflammation while the other was negative, with an additional 22 (8.9%) differing on the extent of inflammation. Eighteen cases with severe inflammation, six with candida and two with EOE were detected only at endoscopy, while 18 with candida and significant inflammation, 13 with ulcer slough, one probable EOE and one viral oesophagitis were identified on the Cytosponge only. Conclusions: The Cytosponge detects a range of benign oesophageal pathologies, and therefore has potential clinical utility in the triaging of patients with troublesome reflux symptoms. This warrants further investigation.\t\t\n",
      "(0.459)  Background: To reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to identify those who are infectious. However, little is known about what proportion of infectious people are asymptomatic and potential silent transmitters. We evaluated the value of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a representative English survey. Methods: We used data from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey pilot study. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, the proportion of asymptomatic cases (1  sensitivity), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker of infection using results of the SARS-CoV-2 test as the gold standard. Results: In total, there were 36,061 individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 test between 26 April and 27 June 2020. Of these, 625 (1.7%) reported symptoms on the day of the test. There were 115 (0.32%) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Of the 115, there were 27 (23.5%) who were symptomatic and 88 (76.5%) who were asymptomatic on the day of the test. Focusing on those with specific symptoms (cough, and/or fever, and/or loss of taste/smell), there were 158 (0.43%) with such symptoms on the day of the test. Of the 115 with a positive SARS-CoV-2, there were 16 (13.9%) reporting symptoms. In contrast, 99 (86.1%) did not report specific symptoms on the day of the test. The PPV for all symptoms was 4.3% and for the specific symptoms 10.1%. The specificity and NPV of symptoms were above 98%. Conclusion: COVID-19 symptoms are poor markers of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 76.5% of this random sample who tested positive reported no symptoms, and 86.1% reported none of those specific to COVID-19. A more widespread testing programme is necessary to capture silent transmission and potentially prevent and reduce future outbreaks.\t\t\n",
      "(0.458)  Background: Lozenges are solid dosage form which are intended to slowly dissolve in the mouth for therapeutic effect. Common cold and flu are common diseases which usually infects the respiratory tract including symptoms like head and body ache, fever, drowsiness, runny nose, congestion and cough. Aim: The present polyherbal lozenge formulations developed to eliminate all symptoms of cold and flu. Although many herbal and allopathic drugs are available, but they are not sufficient to treat all the symptoms through one formulation. Materials and Methods: Jaggery and sugar were dissolved in water and all the juices of drugs mixed and heated till suitable consistency and finally poured in lozenges mold and cooled to form lozenges. Results: The lozenges are evaluated for various quality parameters like hardness, friability, thickness, weight uniformity and disintegration time which comply with the standard mentioned in GMP guidelines. Conclusion: Lozenge is completely herbal containing no synthetic ingredient and is economical to treat all the symptoms of cold and flu.\t\t\n",
      "(0.457)  Background UK veterans suffering from a psychological or psychiatric illness as a consequence of service in the Second World War were entitled to a war pension. Their case files, which include regular medical assessments, are a valuable resource to investigate the nature, distribution and duration of symptoms.Methods A standardised form was used to collect data from pension records of a random sample of 500 UK army veterans from the first presentation in the 1940s until 1980. Data were also gathered from 50 civilians and 54 emergency responders with a pension for post-traumatic illness following air-raids.Results The 10 most common symptoms reported by veterans were anxiety, depression, sleep problems, headache, irritability/anger, tremor/shaking, difficulty completing tasks, poor concentration, repeated fears and avoidance of social contact. Nine of the 10 were widely distributed across the veteran population when symptoms were ranked by the number of subjects who reported them. Nine symptoms persisted significantly longer in the veteran sample than in emergency responders. These included seven of the most common symptoms, together with two others: Muscle pain and restlessness. The persistence of these symptoms in the veteran group suggests a post-traumatic illness linked to lengthy overseas service in combat units.Conclusions The nature and duration of symptoms exhibited by veterans may be associated with their experience of heightened risks. Exposure to severe or prolonged trauma seems to be associated with chronic multi-symptom illness, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and somatic expressions of pain that may delay or complicate the recovery process. \n",

      "(0.814)  We aimed to assess the difference in the accuracy of readings from automated office blood pressure machines with each other or with manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese individuals. We collected awake 48-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, two automated office blood pressure device (BpTRU and WatchBP) readings, and manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese patients (n = 135) with hypertension in a randomized sequence. Differences were compared using paired t-tests and BlandAltman plots. The sensitivity and specificity of the techniques for detecting elevated blood pressure were calculated using awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as the reference standard. The WatchBP devices and awake ambulatory blood pressure readings were similar. The BpTRU device provided significantly lower mean systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressure readings, while manual office BP provided significantly higher mean systolic (P = 0.008) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressure readings than the awake automated office blood pressure readings. Automated and manual office blood pressure measurements showed similar sensitivity, specificity, and 95% limits of agreement as based on BlandAltman plots. The mean systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.02) blood pressure readings of WatchBP and BpTRU differed, and their diagnostic performances were not superior than those of manual office blood pressure measurements in Chinese patients. Therefore, automated office blood pressure measurements cannot be routinely recommended for Chinese individuals in clinical practice. More studies are needed to confirm these results.\t\t\n",
      "(0.725)  Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·979·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·977·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% (21·427·1) in men and 20·1% (17·822·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

      "(0.714)  Background: Heavy metal contamination is widespread in Bangladesh. Previous studies have observed lead increases blood pressure over time. However, the role of other metal contaminants and essential micronutrients, which could also adversely affect blood pressure or act as protective factors, is understudied. Objectives: We therefore evaluated the associations of lead, manganese, and selenium with blood and pulse pressure trajectories. Methods: We prospectively followed placebo-assigned participants nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of arsenic-related skin cancer (n = 255). Blood lead, manganese, and selenium were measured at baseline; blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 3 biennial follow-up examinations. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate associations with average annual changes in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Results: In models simultaneously adjusted for baseline blood lead, manganese, and selenium concentrations in addition to other potential confounders, lead was linearly associated with increases in systolic blood pressure, but not with diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure. A non-linear association was observed for manganese, such that mid-range concentrations were associated with decreases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Baseline selenium concentrations in the highest quartile were also associated with longitudinal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while null associations were observed with pulse pressure. In exploratory analyses, the combination of mid-range manganese and high selenium concentrations completely offset lead-associated increases in blood and pulse pressure. Conclusions: The results indicate a direct, linear association of lead exposure with systolic blood pressure, and manganese and selenium exposures within certain ranges may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in this population. The findings of this study suggest toxic lead exposures remain a significant public health problem in Bangladesh where high levels are associated with high blood pressure; however, the nutritionally essential micronutrients manganese and selenium appear to confer protection from the hypertensive effects of lead.\t\t\n",
      "(0.713)  Background: Change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure could be due to both shifts in the entire distribution of blood pressure (representing the combined effects of public health interventions and secular trends) and changes in its high-blood-pressure tail (representing successful clinical interventions to control blood pressure in the hypertensive population). Our aim was to quantify the contributions of these two phenomena to the worldwide trends in the prevalence of raised blood pressure. Methods: We pooled 1018 population-based studies with blood pressure measurements on 88.6 million participants from 1985 to 2016. We first calculated mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and prevalence of raised blood pressure by sex and 10-year age group from 20-29 years to 70-79 years in each study, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights, where relevant. We used a linear mixed effect model to quantify the association between (probittransformed) prevalence of raised blood pressure and age-group- and sex-specific mean blood pressure. We calculated the contributions of change in mean SBP and DBP, and of change in the prevalence-mean association, to the change in prevalence of raised blood pressure. Results: In 2005-16, at the same level of population mean SBP and DBP, men and women in South Asia and in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa would have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure, and men and women in the highincome Asia Pacific and high-income Western regions would have the lowest. In most region-sex-age groups where the prevalence of raised blood pressure declined, one half or more of the decline was due to the decline in mean blood pressure. Where prevalence of raised blood pressure has increased, the change was entirely driven by increasing mean blood pressure, offset partly by the change in the prevalence-mean association. Conclusions: Change in mean blood pressure is the main driver of the worldwide change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, but change in the high-blood-pressure tail of the distribution has also contributed to the change in prevalence, especially in older age groups.\t\t\n",
      "(0.666)  We have assessed the association between excessive orthostatic changes in blood pressure and risk of incident heart failure (HF) in older, community-dwelling men. This was a prospective cohort study of 3505 men (mean age, 68.5 years), who did not have prevalent HF, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Excessive orthostatic change in blood pressure was defined continuously and categorically as orthostatic hypotension (sitting-to-standing decrease in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), systolic orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg, diastolic orthostatic hypertension as diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), and orthostatic normotension (neither orthostatic hypotension nor orthostatic hypertension). There was a U-shaped association between orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and the risk of incident HF; for diastolic blood pressure, only its fall predicted HF. After adjustment for possible confounders, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for incident HF was 1.65 (1.24-2.18) in men with orthostatic hypotension and 0.90 (0.65-1.24) and 1.88 (1.30-2.73) in men with diastolic and systolic orthostatic hypertension, respectively. Both components of orthostatic hypotension were associated with increased risk, although the systolic component was more predictive than the diastolic component. Both orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension are associated with risk of incident HF in older men. Our findings suggest that orthostatic hypertension is defined by a rise beyond threshold in systolic blood pressure only. Further prospective studies in diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings. \n",

      "(0.6)  The change in hypometabolism affects the regional links in the brain network. Here, to understand the underlying brain metabolic network deficits during the early stage and disease evolution of AD (Alzheimer disease), we applied correlation analysis to identify the metabolic connectivity patterns using 18F-FDG PET data for NC (normal control), sMCI (stable MCI), pMCI (progressive MCI) and AD, and explore the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity between anatomically-defined brain regions. Regions extracted from 90 anatomical structures were used to construct the matrix for measuring the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. The brain connectivity patterns from the metabolic network show a decreasing trend of inter- and intra-hemispheric connections for NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD. Connection of temporal to the frontal or occipital regions is a characteristic pattern for conversion of NC to MCI, and the density of links in the parietal-occipital network is a differential pattern between sMCI and pMCI. The reduction pattern of inter and intra-hemispheric brain connectivity in the metabolic network depends on the disease stages, and is with a decreasing trend with respect to disease severity. Both frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital connectivity patterns in the metabolic network using 18F-FDG PET are the key feature for differentiating disease groups in AD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.555)  Naturalistic theories of disease appeal to concepts of biological function, and use the notion of dysfunction as the basis of their definitions. Debates in the philosophy of biology demonstrate how attributing functions in organisms and establishing the function-dysfunction distinction is by no means straightforward. This problematization of functional ascription has undermined naturalistic theories and led some authors to abandon the concept of dysfunction, favoring instead definitions based in normative criteria or phenomenological approaches. Although this work has enhanced our understanding of disease and illness, we need not necessarily abandon naturalistic concepts of function and dysfunction in the disease debate. This article attempts to move towards a new naturalistic theory of disease that overcomes the limitations of previous definitions and offers advantages in the clinical setting. Our approach involves a re-evaluation of concepts of biological function employed by naturalistic theories. Drawing on recent insights from the philosophy of biology, we develop a contextual and evaluative account of function that is better suited to clinical medicine and remains consistent with contemporary naturalism. We also show how an updated naturalistic view shares important affinities with normativist and phenomenological positions, suggesting a possibility for consilience in the disease debate.\t\t\n",
      "(0.484)  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a pathological process characterized by atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in the epicardial arteries, whether obstructive or non-obstructive. This process can be modified by lifestyle adjustments, pharmacological therapies, and invasive interventions designed to achieve disease stabilization or regression. The disease can have long, stable periods but can also become unstable at any time, typically due to an acute atherothrombotic event caused by plaque rupture or erosion. However, the disease is chronic, most often progressive, and hence serious, even in clinically apparently silent periods. The dynamic nature of the CAD process results in various clinical presentations, which can be conveniently categorized as either acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). The Guidelines presented here refer to the management of patients with CCS. The natural history of CCS is illustrated in Figure 1.\t\t\n",
      "(0.463)  Vascular comorbidities have a deleterious impact on multiple sclerosis clinical outcomes but it is unclear whether this is mediated by an excess of extracranial vascular disease (i.e. atherosclerosis) and/or of cerebral small vessel disease or worse multiple sclerosis pathology. To address these questions, a study using a unique post-mortem cohort wherein whole body autopsy reports and brain tissue were available for interrogation was established. Whole body autopsy reports were used to develop a global score of systemic vascular disease that included aorta and coronary artery atheroma, cardiac hypertensive disease, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. The score was applied to 85 multiple sclerosis cases (46 females, age range 39 to 84 years, median 62.0 years) and 68 control cases. Post-mortem brain material from a subset of the multiple sclerosis (n = 42; age range 39-84 years, median 61.5 years) and control (n = 39) cases was selected for detailed neuropathological study. For each case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from the frontal and occipital white matter, basal ganglia and pons was used to obtain a global cerebral small vessel disease score that captured the presence and/or severity of arteriolosclerosis, periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin leakage, microinfarcts, and microbleeds. The extent of multiple sclerosis-related pathology (focal demyelination and inflammation) was characterized in the multiple sclerosis cases. Regression models were used to investigate the influence of disease status on systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease scores and, in the multiple sclerosis group, the relationship between multiple sclerosis-related pathology and both vascular scores. We show that: (i) systemic cardiovascular burden, and specifically atherosclerosis, is lower and cerebral small vessel disease is higher in multiple sclerosis cases that die at younger ages compared with control subjects; (ii) the association between systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease is stronger in patients with multiple sclerosis compared with control subjects; and (iii) periarteriolar changes, including periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin deposition and inflammation, are key features of multiple sclerosis pathology outside the classic demyelinating lesion. Our data argue against a common primary trigger for atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis but suggest that an excess burden of cerebral small vessel disease in multiple sclerosis may explain the link between vascular comorbidity and accelerated irreversibility disability.\t\t\n",
      "(0.433)  Several philosophers of medicine have attempted to answer the question what is disease? In current clinical practice, an umbrella term chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses a wide range of kidney health states from commonly prevalent subclinical, asymptomatic disease to rare end-stage renal disease requiring transplant or dialysis to support life. Differences in severity are currently expressed using a stage system, whereby stage 1 is the least severe, and stage 5 the most. Early stage CKD in older patients is normal, of little concern, and does not require treatment. However, studies have shown that many patients find being informed of their CKD distressing, even in its early stages. Using existing analyses of disease in the philosophy literature, we argue that the most prevalent diagnoses of CKD are not, in fact, diseases. We conclude that, in many diagnosed cases of CKD, diagnosing a patient with a disease is not only redundant, but unhelpful. \n",

      "(0.565)  As dementia becomes more prevalent in the aging population, clinicians increasingly face the challenge of caring for patients who had told family members that they preferred death to life with advanced dementia. Advance directives can guide management, but usually are inadequate in caring for patients with advanced dementia. The now patient has very different sensibilities than the then patient who had expressed preferences for terminal care before dementia severely impaired cognition and executive function. Clinicians lack clear means of following a patient's directive to die rather than to live with advanced dementia. Withholding life-sustaining oral feeding or fluids is ethically problematic. Controversies remain over precedent autonomy as the justification for advance dementia directives, and the consequent legal, ethical, and practical issues clinicians face, particularly involving feeding.\t\t\n",
      "(0.534)  Objective: We assessed long-term incidence and prevalence trends of dementia and parkinsonism across major ethnic and immigrant groups in Ontario. Methods: Linking administrative databases, we established two cohorts (dementia 2001-2014 and parkinsonism 2001-2015) of all residents aged 20 to 100 years with incident diagnosis of dementia (N = 387,937) or parkinsonism (N = 59,617). We calculated age-and sex-standardized incidence and prevalence of dementia and parkinsonism by immigrant status and ethnic groups (Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population). We assessed incidence and prevalence trends using Poisson regression and Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Results: Across selected ethnic groups, dementia incidence and prevalence were higher in long-term residents than recent or longer-term immigrants from 2001 to 2014. During this period, age-and sex-standardized incidence of dementia in Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population increased, respectively, among longer-term immigrants (by 41%, 58%, and 42%) and long-term residents (28%, 7%, and 4%), and to a lesser degree among recent immigrants. The small number of cases precluded us from assessing parkinsonism incidence trends. For Chinese, South Asian, and the General Population, respectively, prevalence of dementia and parkinsonism modestly increased over time among recent immigrants but significantly increased among longer-term immigrants (dementia: 134%, 217%, and 117%; parkinsonism: 55%, 54%, and 43%) and long-term residents (dementia: 97%, 132%, and 71%; parkinsonism: 18%, 30%, and 29%). Adjustment for pre-existing conditions did not appear to explain incidence trends, except for stroke and coronary artery disease as potential drivers of dementia incidence. Conclusion: Recent immigrants across major ethnic groups in Ontario had considerably lower rates of dementia and parkinsonism than long-term residents, but this difference diminished with longer-term immigrants.\t\t\n",
      "(0.528)  Previous literature reveals a high prevalence of grief in dementia caregivers before physical death of the person with dementia that is associated with stress, burden, and depression. To date, theoretical models and therapeutic interventions with grief in caregivers have not adequately considered the grief process, but instead have focused on grief as a symptom that manifests within the process of caregiving. The Dementia Grief Model explicates the unique process of pre-death grief in dementia caregivers. In this paper we introduce the Dementia Grief Model, describe the unique characteristics of dementia grief, and present the psychological states associated with the process of dementia grief. The model explicates an iterative grief process involving three statesseparation, liminality, and re-emergenceeach with a dynamic mechanism that facilitates or hinders movement through the dementia grief process. Finally, we offer potential applied research questions informed by the model.\t\t\n",
      "(0.521)  Dementia, a term that describes a variety of brain conditions marked by gradual, persistent and progressive cognitive decline, affects a significant proportion of older adults. Older adults with dementia are sometimes perceived less favourably than those without dementia. Furthermore, compared to persons without dementia, those with dementia are often perceived by others as having reduced personhood. This study was aimed at investigating whether differences in attitudes towards dementia and personhood perceptions vary as a function of age group, care-giver status, attitudes towards ageing, dementia knowledge, gender and education. In total 196 younger, middle-aged and older adults were recruited. Findings revealed that being a care-giver as well as having less ageist attitudes were predictive of being more comfortable around persons with dementia, having more knowledge about dementia and ascribing greater personhood to people with dementia. Those with more dementia knowledge (prior to the study) were less comfortable around people with dementia. Finally, when controlling this prior dementia knowledge, older adults were more comfortable around people with dementia compared to younger and middle-aged adults. Gender and education were not associated with any of the variables under study. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of age-and care-giver-related factors in the determination of attitudes towards dementia.\t\t\n",
      "(0.514)  Background: The number of older people living with dementia is increasing. Admiral Nurses work with these individuals and their families in the UK to manage challenges associated with the condition, providing guidance, advice and reassurance, alongside practical solutions. Aim: To explore the input of Admiral Nurses as part of people's journey to becoming and being a carer for someone with dementia. Design: A qualitative study was conducted to describe and understand how Admiral Nurses are experienced and encountered by carers as part of their narrative around supporting a relative with dementia. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 carers between November 2017April 2018. They lasted between 45 and 90 min. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data. Findings: An overarching concept of the unitydivision paradox was derived from the data. This highlights the complex interchange between the carer with (a) the person with dementia, (b) other individuals and (c) external services. Such interactions can make carers feel part of a larger network (unity) but also as if they are on their own, fighting on behalf of the person with dementia (division). This concept was underpinned by the following themes: (a) I becomes we; (b) My private world is encroached by dementia; (c) Im left navigating an unwieldy system; (d) Are you with or against us?; and (e) Recreating boundaries to rediscover me. Conclusion: The identity and unique characteristics and interests of those caring for a person with dementia may be lost as they encounter tensions associated with the unitydivision paradox. Admiral Nurses can help carers feel less alone in managing internal and external struggles by supporting them to do their best for a loved one with dementia. Implications for practice: Understanding carers experience and supporting their work may help to increase and sustain their capacity to provide care. \n",

      "(0.581)  Background: Menopause timing is related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Lead has been associated with an earlier age at menopause, but no study has considered exposure to other metals or multiple metals simultaneously. Methods: At baseline, we measured toenail concentrations of 16 metals for 903 premenopausal women in the Sister Study (2003-2009). Age at menopause was ascertained through follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between individual metals and age at menopause. We used quantile-g-computation to examine the association between age at menopause and the joint effect of a simultaneous increase in (1) all metals and for subgroups of metals categorized as (2) essential or (3) non-essential. Results: For individual metals, we observed negligible associations except for an interquartile range increase in lead which was modestly associated with an earlier age at menopause (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05). In the mixture analyses, a quartile increase in all metals was associated with a later age at menopause (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.02). The metals with the largest negative contributions (i.e., associated with a later age at menopause) were chromium and nickel. The joint effect for the essential metals remained inverse (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.07), but was attenuated for nonessential metals (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76, 1.24). Conclusions: Although no individual metal was strongly associated with age at menopause, our joint effect analysis suggests that having low levels of essential metals could be associated with an earlier age at menopause.\t\t\n",
      "(0.518)  Understanding demographic differences in transitions across physical activity (PA) levels is important for informing PA-promoting interventions, yet few studies have examined these transitions in contemporary multi-ethnic adult populations. We estimated age-, race/ethnicity-, and sex-specific 1-year net transition probabilities (NTPs) for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (20072012, n = 11,556) and Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (20082011, n = 15,585) adult participants using novel Markov-type state transition models developed for cross-sectional data. Among populations with ideal PA (= 150 min/week; ranging from 56% (non-Hispanic black females) to 88% (non-Hispanic white males) at age 20), NTPs to intermediate PA (> 0<149 min/week) generally increased with age, particularly for non-Hispanic black females for whom a net 0.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 0.2) transitioned from ideal to intermediate PA at age 20; by age 70, the NTP rose to 3.6% (95% CI: 2.3, 4.8). Heterogeneity in intermediate to poor (0 min/week) PA NTPs also was observed, with NTPs peaking at age 20 for Hispanic/Latino males and females [age 20 NTP = 3.7% (95% CI: 2.0, 5.5) for females and 5.0% (1.2, 8.7) for males], but increasing throughout adulthood for non-Hispanic blacks and whites [e.g. age 70 NTP = 7.8% (95% CI: 6.1, 9.6%) for black females and 8.1% (4.7, 11.6) for black males]. Demographic differences in PA net transitions across adulthood justify further development of tailored interventions. However, innovative efforts may be required for populations in which large proportions have already transitioned from ideal PA by early adulthood.\t\t\n",

Currently, no body fat percent (BF%) centile distance and velocity curves exist for Canadian youth. Objectives: To develop sex-specific and ethnic-specific BF% centile distance and velocity curves for White and Asian-Canadian youth. Methods: We utilized 4734 observations from 944 participants (female = 487; Asian = 532) to create sex-specific BF% velocity curves for age 10 to 18 years and sex-specific and ethnic-specific BF% percentile distance curves for ages 9 to 18 years for White and Asian children. BF% was derived from whole body DXA scans. Results: BF% centile distance curves for Asian and White girls were similar. BF% at most centiles plateaued around age 16 for Asian but not for White boys. Velocity curves for boys declined from age 11 to 13 years and then increased until age 18 years. For girls from 10 to 15 years, velocity curves converged towards the 50th centile then remained flat from 16 to 18 years. Conclusions: BF% distance and velocity centiles can be used to identify when an individual veers from an average BF% accrual trajectory. In future, these curves may be used to investigate differences in fat mass and accrual across Canada.\t\t\n",

Methods: Prospective observational study recruited 71 healthy individuals divided into two groups according to their age i.e. younger (=40 years of age, N = 43); and older (=55 years of age, N = 28). All participants underwent maximal graded cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing using cycle ergometer with simultaneous non-invasive gas-exchange and central haemodynamic measurements. Using the Fick equation, arteriovenous O2 difference was calculated as the ratio between measured O2 consumption and cardiac output. Results: The mean age of younger and older participants was 26.0 ± 5.7 years, and 65.1 ± 6.6 years respectively. Peak O2 consumption was significantly lower in older compared to the younger age group (18.8 ± 5.2 vs 34.4 ± 9.8 mL/kg/min, p < 0.01). Peak exercise cardiac output and cardiac index were not significantly different between the younger and older age groups (22.7 ± 5.0 vs 22.1 ± 3.9 L/min, p = 0.59; and 12.4 ± 2.9 vs 11.8 ± 1.9 L/min/m2, p = 0.29). Despite demonstrating significantly lower peak heart rate by 33 beats/min (129 ± 18.3 vs 162 ± 19.9, p < 0.01), older participants demonstrated significantly higher stroke volume and stroke volume index compared to the younger age group (173 ± 41.5 vs 142 ± 34.9 mL/min, p < 0.01; and 92.1 ± 18.1 vs 78.3 ± 19.5 mL/m2, p < 0.01). Arteriovenous O2 difference was significantly lower in older compared to younger age group participants (9.01 ± 3.0 vs 15.8 ± 4.3 mlO2/100 mL blood, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Ability of skeletal muscles to extract delivered oxygen represented by reduced arteriovenous O2 difference at peak exercise appears to be the key determinant of exercise tolerance in healthy older individuals.\t\t\n",
      "(0.477)  Skeletal maturity can be used as a biological indicator of the tempo of growth in children and adolescents. We present a description of skeletal maturity from a cohort of white Australian children and describe variation in skeletal maturity based on child age. Participants (n = 71; age 10.513.9 years) were recruited from the Healthy, Active Preschool & Primary Years (HAPPY) study. Left hand-wrist radiographs were used to determine skeletal maturity using the Tanner-Whitehouse III (TW3) RUS technique. In boys, the mean skeletal maturity offset (bone agechronological age) was -0.12 ± 0.19 years and 57.9% had delayed skeletal maturity compared to chronological age. Among those with delayed skeletal maturity, the average delay was 0.99 years (range 0.022.54 years). In girls, skeletal age was advanced, on average, compared to chronological age by 0.32 ± 0.20 years. Among the 39.4% of girls with delayed skeletal maturity, the average delay was 0.48 years (range: 0.012.28). Four children in the sample exhibited a delay in skeletal maturity greater than 2 years. In the context of secular trends towards advanced skeletal maturity observed globally, delayed skeletal maturation in this white, economically privileged cohort are surprising and warrant further exploration. \n",

      "(0.77)  Background: The physical environment can facilitate or hinder physical activity. A challenge in promoting physical activity is ensuring that the physical environment is supportive and that these supports are appropriately tailored to the individual or group in question. Ideally, aspects of the environment that impact physical activity would be enhanced, but environmental changes take time, and identifying ways to provide more precision to physical activity recommendations might be helpful for specific individuals or groups. Therefore, moving beyond a one size fits all to a precision-based approach is critical. Main body: To this end, we considered 4 critical aspects of the physical environment that influence physical activity (walkability, green space, traffic-related air pollution, and heat) and how these aspects could enhance our ability to precisely guide physical activity. Strategies to increase physical activity could include optimizing design of the built environment or mitigating of some of the environmental impediments to activity through personalized or population-wide interventions. Conclusions: Although at present non-personalized approaches may be more widespread than those tailored to one persons physical environment, targeting intrinsic personal elements (e.g., medical conditions, sex, age, socioeconomic status) has interesting potential to enhance the likelihood and ability of individuals to participate in physical activity.\t\t\n",
      "(0.677)  Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and characterize patterns of physical activity among office workers employed in largely sedentary occupations at a major health insurer located in the Southeastern USA. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used latent class analysis to identify segments of office workers (n=239) based on their self-reported activities of daily living and exercise behaviors. The authors examined the association of demographic characteristics with segment membership, and differences in accelerometer-measured weekly minutes of light and moderate-vigorous physical activity across segments. Findings - The authors identified two segments and labeled them \"exerciser\" and \"non-exerciser.\" Being female was associated with lower odds of membership in the \"exerciser\" segment (OR=0.18; 95% CI=0.06, 0.52), while those with at least a bachelor's degree were more likely to be in the \"exerciser\" segment (OR=2.12; 95% CI=1.02, 4.40). Mean minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per week were greater for the \"exerciser\" segment than the \"non-exerciser\" segment. Practical implications - Based on this sample, the authors found that office workers in sedentary occupations were roughly equally divided and distinguished by their engagement in exercise-type behaviors. The findings underscore the need for innovative workplace programming that enhances activity opportunities particularly for those that are not likely to exercise. Originality/value - A scarcity of research on activity patterns among office workers inhibits development of targeted worksite activity programming. The present research reveals two segments of workers with regard to their activity patterns and suggests ways for worksites to meet their unique needs.\t\t\n",
      "(0.668)  Background N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity Troponin T (hsTnT) are markers of cardiac injury used in diagnosis of heart failure and myocardial infarction respectively, and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Since physical activity is protective against cardiovascular disease and heart failure, we investigated whether higher levels of physical activity, and less sedentary behaviour were associated with lower NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Methods and results Cross sectional study of 1130 men, age 7091 years, from the British Regional Heart Study, measured in 20102012. Fasting blood samples were analysed for NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Relationships between activity and NT-proBNP or hsTnT were non-linear; biomarker levels were lower with higher total activity, steps, moderate/vigorous activity and light activity only at low to moderate levels of activity. For example, for each additional 10 min of moderate/vigorous activity, NT-proBNP was lower by 35.7% (95% CI - 47.9, - 23.6) and hsTnT by 8.4% (95% CI -11.1, - 5.6), in men who undertook < 25 or 50 min of moderate/vigorous activity per day respectively. Biomarker levels increased linearly with increasing sedentary behaviour, but not independently of moderate/vigorous activity. Conclusion Associations between biomarkers and moderate/vigorous activity (and between hsTnT and light activity) were independent of sedentary behaviour, suggesting activity is driving the relationships. In these older men with concomitantly low levels of physical activity, activity may be more important in protecting against cardiac health deterioration in less active individuals, although reverse causality might be operating.\t\t\n",

A group of 123 community-dwelling older adults (Ma = ENGL = 71.83, range = 64 85, 63% women) from Canada participated in a 10-day time-sampling study. We used accelerometer-assessed physical activity, assessing negative affect three times per day and fear of falling once prior to the 10-day period. Using multilevel models, we noted considerable variability in physical activity between days (activity counts: 47%; steps: 55%). We found time-varying negative associations between daily physical activity and daily negative affect. Fear of falling was not related to daily physical activity. Findings point to the merit of examining time-varying differences in subjective experiences when looking for physical activity barriers in older age.\t\t\n",
      "(0.652)  Objectives: Physical activity is a key health behavior that reduces disease risk, and yet most older adults are not very active. This study examined time-varying associations between physical activity and a recognized barrier, namely, precipitation. And it examined the moderating role of physical activity intentions and functional mobility on precipitationphysical activity associations. Method: One hundred and twenty-six older adults (M age = 72 years; 64% women) from Metro Vancouver provided health and background information and wore triaxial accelerometers for up to 10 consecutive days. Daily weather information was collected from local weather stations. Results: Multilevel models corroborate previous research by showing that older adults engaged in less physical activity on days with increased precipitation across four indices: activity counts, step counts, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and bout-corrected minutes of MVPA. Older adults with strong physical activity intentions engaged in more physical activity overall. Physical activity intentions also modified the association between time-varying precipitation and activity counts and step counts, whereas functional mobility moderated the negative association between precipitation and activity counts and minutes of MVPA. Discussion: Findings highlight the important role of time-varying influences on physical activity and how these associations are moderated by psychological and biological factors. \n",

      "(0.457)  A team-based 12-month lifestyle program for the treatment of metabolic syndrome (MetS) (involving physicians, registered dietitians (RDs), and kinesiologists) was previously shown to reverse MetS in 19% of patients (95% confidence interval, 14% to 24%). This work evaluates changes in nutrient intake and diet quality over 12 months (n = 205). Individualized diet counselling was provided by 14 RDs at 3 centres. Two 24-h recalls, the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C), and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) were completed at each time point. Total energy intake decreased by 145 ± 586 kcal (mean ± SD) over 3 months with an additional 76 ± 452 kcal decrease over 312 months. HEI-C improved from 58 ± 15 to 69 ± 12 at 3 months and was maintained at 12 months. Similarly, MDS (n = 144) improved from 4.8 ± 1.2 to 6.2 ± 1.9 at 3 months and was maintained at 12 months. Changes were specific to certain food groups, with increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and nuts and decreased intake of other foods and commercial baked goods being the most prominent changes. There was limited change in intake of olive oil, fish, and legumes. Exploratory analysis suggested that poorer diet quality at baseline was associated with greater dietary changes as assessed by HEI-C. Novelty  Multiple dietary assessment tools provided rich information on food intake changes in an intervention for metabolic syndrome.  Improvements in diet were achieved by 3 months and maintained to 12 months.  The results provide a basis for further dietary change implementation studies in the Canadian context.\t\t\n",
      "(0.424)  Background: To evaluate computed tomography (CT) patterns of post-SBRT lung injury in lung cancer and identify time points of serial CT changes. Materials and methods: One hundred eighty-three tumors in 170 patients were evaluated on sequential CTs within 29 months (median). Frequencies of post-SBRT CT patterns and time points of initiation and duration were assessed. Duration of increase of primary lesion or surrounding injury without evidence of local recurrence and time to stabilization or local recurrence were evaluated. Results: Post-SBRT CT patterns could overlap in the same patient and were nodule-like pattern (69%), consolidation with ground glass opacity (GGO) (41%), modified conventional pattern (39%), peribronchial/patchy consolidation (42%), patchy GGO (24%), diffuse consolidation (16%), orbit sign (21%), mass-like pattern (19%), scar-like pattern (15%) and diffuse GGO (3%). Patchy GGO started at 4 months post-SBRT. Peribronchial/patchy consolidation and consolidation with GGO started at 4 and 5 months respectively. Diffuse consolidation, diffuse GGO and orbit sign started at 5, 6 and 8 months respectively. Mass-like, modified conventional and scar-like pattern started at 8, 12 and 12 months respectively. Primary lesion (n = 11) or surrounding injury (n = 85) increased up to 13 months. Primary lesion (n = 119) or surrounding injury (n = 115) started to decrease at 4 and 9 months respectively. Time to stabilization was 20 months. The most common CT pattern at stabilization was modified conventional pattern (49%), scar-like pattern (23%) and mass-like pattern (12%). Local recurrence (n = 15) occurred at a median time of 18 months. Conclusion: Different CT patterns of lung injury post-SBRT appear in predictable time points and have variable but predictable duration. Familiarity with these patterns and timeframes of appearance helps differentiate them from local recurrence.\t\t\n",

In vitro testing of the revised IR and in vivo implantation in rabbit brain and leg tissues. Revised IRs were fabricated with 14 OxyChips with a thin wire encapsulated with two biocompatible coatings. Biocompatibility and chemical characterization tests were performed. Rabbits were implanted with either an IR with 2 oxygen sensors or a biocompatible-control sample in both the brain and hind leg. The rabbits were implanted with IRs using a catheter-based, minimally invasive surgical procedure. EPR oximetry was performed for rabbits with IRs. Cohorts of rabbits were euthanized and tissues were obtained at 1 week, 3 months, and 9 months after implantation and examined for tissue reaction. Biocompatibility and toxicity testing of the revised IRs demonstrated no abnormal reactions. EPR oximetry from brain and leg tissues were successfully executed. Blood work and histopathological evaluations showed no significant difference between the IR and control groups. IRs were functional for up to 9 months after implantation and provided deep tissue oxygen measurements using EPR oximetry. Tissues surrounding the IRs showed no more tissue reaction than tissues surrounding the control samples. This pre-clinical study demonstrates that the IRs can be safely implanted in brain and leg tissues and that repeated, non-invasive, deep-tissue oxygen measurements can be obtained using in vivo EPR oximetry.\t\t\n",
      "(0.373)  High protein intake in young children is associated with excess gains in weight and body fat, but the specific role of different protein sources has yet to be described. The study aimed to investigate the role of different types of protein in the post-weaning stage on weight, BMI and overweight/obesity at 60 months. Intakes of animal, dairy and plant protein and a dietary pattern characterising variation in protein types at 21 months of age were estimated using a 3-d diet diary in a cohort of 2154 twins; weight and height were recorded every 3 months from birth to 60 months. Longitudinal mixed-effect models investigated the associations between sources of protein intake or dietary pattern scores and BMI, weight and overweight/obesity from 21 months up to 60 months. Adjusting for confounders, dairy protein intake at 21 months was positively associated with greater weight (46 (95 % CI 21, 71) g and BMI up to 60 months (0·04 (95 % CI 0·004, 0·070) kg/m2) and the odds of overweight/obesity at 3 years (OR 1·12; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·24). Milk showed associations of similar magnitude. A dietary pattern low in dairy protein and high in plant protein was associated with lower weight gain up to 60 months, but not overweight/obesity. Intake of dairy products in early childhood is most strongly associated with weight gain, compared with other protein sources. A dietary pattern characterised by lower protein intake and greater protein source diversity at 2 years may confer a lower risk of excess weight gain.\t\t\n",
      "(0.361)  Objective: This study assessed whether immediate postpartum insertion of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants is associated with a difference in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 and 6 months postpartum compared to delayed insertion at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. Study design: We conducted a randomized trial of women in Uganda who desired contraceptive implants postpartum. We randomly assigned participants to receive either immediate (within 5 days of delivery) or delayed (6 to 8 weeks postpartum) insertion of a two-rod levonorgestrel contraceptive implant system. This is a prespecified secondary analysis evaluating breastfeeding outcomes. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was change in infant weight; infants were weighed and measured at birth and 6 months. We used a validated questionnaire to assess onset of lactogenesis daily in person while participants were in the hospital, and then daily by phone after they left the hospital, until lactogenesis was documented. We used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess breastfeeding continuation and concerns at 3 months and 6 months postpartum. Results: Among the 96 women randomized to the immediate group and the 87 women to the delayed group, the mean change in infant weight from birth to 6 months was similar between groups: 4632 g in the immediate group and 4407 g in the delayed group (p=.26). Among the 97 women who had not experienced lactogenesis prior to randomization, the median time to onset of lactogenesis did not differ significantly between the immediate and delayed groups (65 h versus 63 h; p=.84). Similar proportions of women in the immediate and delayed groups reported exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (74% versus 71%; p=.74) and 6 months (48% versus 52%; p=.58). Conclusion: We found no association between the timing of postpartum initiation of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants and change in infant growth from birth to 6 months, onset of lactogenesis, or breastfeeding continuation at 3 or 6 months postpartum. Implications: This study provides evidence that immediate postpartum initiation of contraception implants does not have a deleterious effect on infant growth or initiation or continuation of breastfeeding. \n",

It focuses on the perspective of residential care providers on implementing direct payments, which aimed to improve the level of choice and control over care available to their residents. The article explores the views of providers, using interviews and survey responses of care home managers and owners. Concerns expressed by providers include issues that have arisen in domiciliary care but also issues specific to residential care, especially challenges in facilitating greater choice and control in settings that provide care collectively for substantial numbers of residents.\t\t\n",
      "(0.556)  This paper examines how care home managers in England conceptualised the approach to delivering personalised care in the homes they managed. We conducted interviews with care home managers and mapped the approaches they described on two distinct characterisations of personalised care prominent in the research and practitioner literature: the importance of close care relationships and the degree of resident choice and decision-making promoted by the care home. We derived three 'types' of personalised care in care homes. These conceptualise the care home as an 'institution', a 'family' and a 'hotel'. We have added a fourth type, the 'co-operative', to propose a type that merges proximate care relationships with an emphasis on resident choice and decision-making. We conclude that each approach involves trade-offs and that the 'family' model may be more suitable for people with advanced dementia, given its emphasis on relationships. While the presence of a range of diverse approaches to personalising care in a care home market may be desirable as a matter of choice, access to care homes in England is likely to be constrained by availability and cost.\t\t\n",

As part of its agenda to modernize social care, the Government tested their use in long-term residential care in 18 trailblazing councils in England. This article presents findings from the independent evaluation of this initiative, using interviews with project leads seconded to the programme in all participating councils, and with council and care home staff involved in implementing direct payments in residential care in five sites. Interviews were conducted between September 2014 and November 2015. They explored professionals' views and experiences of personalization in residential care and their thoughts on the potential contribution of direct payments to promoting personalization. Whilst there was agreement that good care takes personal preferences into account and that many care homes could provide a more personalized service, doubts were voiced about whether direct payments were an appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim. This was seen as particularly pertinent in relation to residents with very high care needs and limited capacity to exercise choice and control. Interviewees also identified a number of risks and challenges to implementation, including financial risks to care homes. The findings from these interviews suggest that the contribution of direct payments to personalizing residential care may be more modest than expected.\t\t\n",
      "(0.485)  Background: Little population-level information exists about the delivery of palliative care across multiple health sectors, important in providing a complete picture of current care and gaps in care. Aim: Provide a population perspective on end-of-life palliative care delivery across health sectors. Design: Retrospective population-level cohort study, describing palliative care in the last year of life using linked health administrative databases. Setting/participants: All decedents in Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012 (n = 177,817). Results: Across all health sectors, about half (51.9%) of all decedents received at least one record of palliative care in the last year of life. Being female, middle-aged, living in wealthier and urban neighborhoods, having cancer, and less multi-morbidity were all associated with higher odds of palliative care receipt. Among 92,276 decedents receiving palliative care, 84.9% received care in acute care hospitals. Among recipients, 35 mean days of palliative care were delivered. About half (49.1%) of all palliative care days were delivered in the last 2 months of life, and half (50.1%) had palliative care initiated in this period. Only about one-fifth of all decedents (19.3%) received end-of-life care through publicly funded home care. Less than 10% of decedents had a record of a palliative care home visit from a physician. Conclusion: We describe methods to capture palliative care using administrative data. Despite an estimate of overall reach (51.9%) that is higher than previous estimates, we have shown that palliative care is infrequently delivered particularly in community settings and to non-cancer patients and occurs close to death.\t\t\n",
      "(0.452)  In 2012 Oregon initiated an ambitious delivery system reform, moving the majority of its Medicaid enrollees into sixteen coordinated care organizations, a type of Medicaid accountable care organization. Using claims data, we assessed measures of access, appropriateness of care, utilization, and expenditures for five service areas (evaluation and management, imaging, procedures, tests, and inpatient facility care), comparing Oregon to the neighboring state of Washington. Overall, the transformation into coordinated care organizations was associated with a 7 percent relative reduction in expenditures across the sum of these services, attributable primarily to reductions in inpatient utilization. The change to coordinated care organizations also demonstrated reductions in avoidable emergency department visits and improvements in some measures of appropriateness of care, but also exhibited reductions in primary care visits, a potential area of concern. Oregon's coordinated care organizations could provide lessons for controlling health care spending for other state Medicaid programs. \n",

      "(0.611)  Purpose: To develop a machine learning model to classify the severity grades of pulmonary edema on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 369 071 chest radiographs and associated radiology reports from 64 581 patients (mean age, 51.71 years; 54.51% women) from the MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph dataset were included. This dataset was split into patients with and without congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary edema severity labels from the associated radiology reports were extracted from patients with CHF as four different ordinal levels: 0, no edema; 1, vascular congestion; 2, interstitial edema; and 3, alveolar edema. Deep learning models were developed using two approaches: a semisupervised model using a variational autoencoder and a pretrained supervised learning model using a dense neural network. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on both models. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for differentiating alveolar edema from no edema was 0.99 for the semisupervised model and 0.87 for the pretrained models. Performance of the algorithm was inversely related to the difficulty in categorizing milder states of pulmonary edema (shown as AUCs for semisupervised model and pretrained model, respectively): 2 versus 0, 0.88 and 0.81; 1 versus 0, 0.79 and 0.66; 3 versus 1, 0.93 and 0.82; 2 versus 1, 0.69 and 0.73; and 3 versus 2, 0.88 and 0.63. Conclusion: Deep learning models were trained on a large chest radiograph dataset and could grade the severity of pulmonary edema on chest radiographs with high performance.\t\t\n",
      "(0.562)  In light of the low signal-to-noise nature of many large biological data sets, we propose a novel method to learn the structure of association networks using Gaussian graphical models combined with prior knowledge. Our strategy includes two parts. In the first part, we propose a model selection criterion called structural Bayesian information criterion, in which the prior structure is modeled and incorporated into Bayesian information criterion. It is shown that the popular extended Bayesian information criterion is a special case of structural Bayesian information criterion. In the second part, we propose a two-step algorithm to construct the candidate model pool. The algorithm is data-driven and the prior structure is embedded into the candidate model automatically. Theoretical investigation shows that under some mild conditions structural Bayesian information criterion is a consistent model selection criterion for high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model. Simulation studies validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the existing ones and show the robustness to the model misspecification. Application to relative concentration data from infant feces collected from subjects enrolled in a large molecular epidemiological cohort study validates that metabolic pathway involvement is a statistically significant factor for the conditional dependence between metabolites. Furthermore, new relationships among metabolites are discovered which can not be identified by the conventional methods of pathway analysis. Some of them have been widely recognized in biological literature.\t\t\n",
      "(0.548)  Latent change score models (LCSMs) are used across disciplines in behavioural sciences to study how constructs change over time. LCSMs can be used to estimate the trajectory of one construct (univariate) and allow the investigation of how changes between two constructs (bivariate) are associated with each other over time. This paper introduces the R package lcsm, a tool that aims to help users understand, analyse, and visualise different latent change score models. The lcsm package provides functions to generate model syntax for basic univariate and bivariate latent change score models with different model specifications. It is also possible to visualise different model specifications in simplified path diagrams. An interactive application illustrates the main functions of the package and demonstrates how the model syntax and path diagrams change based on different model specifications. This R package aims to increase the transparency of reporting analyses and to provide an additional resource to learn latent change score modelling.\t\t\n",
      "(0.52)  Composite endpoints are commonplace in biomedical research. The complex nature of many health conditions and medical interventions demand that composite endpoints be employed. Different approaches exist for the analysis of composite endpoints. A Monte Carlo simulation study was employed to assess the statistical properties of various regression methods for analyzing binary composite endpoints. We also applied these methods to data from the BETTER trial which employed a binary composite endpoint. We demonstrated that type 1 error rates are poor for the Negative Binomial regression model and the logistic generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Bias was minimal and power was highest in the binomial logistic regression model, the linear regression model, the Poisson (corrected for over-dispersion) regression model and the common effect logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Convergence was poor in the distinct effect GEE models, the logistic GLMM and some of the zero-one inflated beta regression models. Considering the BETTER trial data, the distinct effect GEE model struggled with convergence and the collapsed composite method estimated an effect, which was greatly attenuated compared to other models. All remaining models suggested an intervention effect of similar magnitude. In our simulation study, the binomial logistic regression model (corrected for possible over/under-dispersion), the linear regression model, the Poisson regression model (corrected for over-dispersion) and the common effect logistic GEE model appeared to be unbiased, with good type 1 error rates, power and convergence properties.\t\t\n",
      "(0.497)  The accelerated failure time (AFT) model has been suggested as an alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model. However, a parametric AFT model requires the specification of an appropriate distribution for the event time, which is often difficult to identify in real-life studies and may limit applications. A semiparametric AFT model was developed by Komárek et al based on smoothed error distribution that does not require such specification. In this article, we develop a spline-based AFT model that also does not require specification of the parametric family of event time distribution. The baseline hazard function is modeled by regression B-splines, allowing for the estimation of a variety of smooth and flexible shapes. In comprehensive simulations, we validate the performance of our approach and compare with the results from parametric AFT models and the approach of Komárek. Both the proposed spline-based AFT model and the approach of Komárek provided unbiased estimates of covariate effects and survival curves for a variety of scenarios in which the event time followed different distributions, including both simple and complex cases. Spline-based estimates of the baseline hazard showed also a satisfactory numerical stability. As expected, the baseline hazard and survival probabilities estimated by the misspecified parametric AFT models deviated from the truth. We illustrated the application of the proposed model in a study of colon cancer. \n",

Methods: We calculated variation in, and correlations among, 10 quality measures across 306 Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs), adjusting for beneficiary traits and sample size differences. Further, we created a quality index and correlated it with spending. Results: The coefficient of variation of HRR-level performance ranged from 0.04 to 0.38.

      "(0.53)  Objective: To explore how organizations respond to and interact with the accreditation process and the actual and potential mechanisms through which accreditation may influence quality. Design: Qualitative grounded theory study. Setting: Organizations who had participated in Accreditation Canada's Qmentum program during January 2014-June 2016. Participants: Individuals who had coordinated the accreditation process or were involved in managing or promoting quality. Results: The accreditation process is largely viewed as a quality assurance process, which often feeds in to quality improvement activities if the feedback aligns with organizational priorities. Three key stages are required for accreditation to impact quality: coherence, organizational buy-in and organizational action. These stages map to constructs outlined in Normalization Process Theory. Coherence is established when an organization and its staff perceive that accreditation aligns with the organization's beliefs, context and model of service delivery. Organizational buy-in is established when there is both a conceptual champion and an operational champion, and is influenced by both internal and external contextual factors. Quality improvement action occurs when organizations take purposeful action in response to observations, feedback or self-reflection resulting from the accreditation process. Conclusions: The accreditation process has the potential to influence quality through a series of three mechanisms: coherence, organizational buy-in and collective quality improvement action. Internal and external contextual factors, including individual characteristics, influence an organization's experience of accreditation.\t\t\n",
      "(0.529)  Background Previous studies have demonstrated significant associations between cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality metrics and survival to hospital discharge. No adequately powered study has explored the relationship between location of resuscitation (scene vs. transport) and CPR quality. Methods We analyzed CPR quality data from treated adult OHCA occurring over a 40 month period beginning January 1, 2013 from the Rescu Epistry-cardiac arrest database. High quality CPR was defined as chest compression fraction (CCF) >0.7, compression rate >100/min and compression depth >5.0 cm. Our primary objective was to compare the proportion of resuscitations for which all CPR quality benchmarks were met between scene and transport phases of resuscitation. Our secondary objectives were to compare the quality of CPR between the scene phase and transport phase of resuscitation. Results The proportion of patients with high quality CPR was similar on scene compared to during transport (45.8% vs. 42.5%; <U+2206> 3.3 %; 95% CI: -1.4, 8.1). Regarding individual CPR metrics, median compression rate was higher on scene compared to transport (105.8 compressions per minute (cpm) vs. 102.0 cpm; <U+2206> 3.8 cpm; 95% CI: 2.5, 4.0), while median compression depth (5.56 cm vs. 5.33 cm; <U+2206> 0.23 cm; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.26) and median CCF (0.95 vs. 0.87; <U+2206> 0.08; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.08) were higher during the transport phase. Conclusions High quality CPR metrics were similar in both (scene and transport) locations of resuscitation. These results suggest that high quality, manual compressions can be performed by prehospital providers regardless of location.\t\t\n",

In this article, we use a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and existing quality metrics to explore the impact of changes in quality metric methodology on measured quality performance, the association with patient outcomes, and hospital rankings. Methods and Results: We used 100% Medicare Parts A and B and a random 40% sample of Part D from 2008 to 2015 to create (1) a cohort of 295 494 fee-for-service beneficiaries with =1 hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and (2) a cohort of 1079 hospitals with =11 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction admissions in 2014 and 2015. We used Part D data to calculate ß-blocker use after discharge and ß-blocker use over time. We then varied the quality metric methodologies to explore the impact on measured performance. We then used multivariable time-to-event analyses to explore the impact of metric methodology on the association between quality performance and patient outcomes and Kendall's Tau to describe impact of quality metric methodology on hospital rankings. We found that quality metric methodology had a significant impact on measured quality performance. The association between quality performance and readmissions was sensitive to changes in methodology but the association with 1-year mortality was not. Changes in quality metric methodology also had a substantial impact on hospital quality rankings. Conclusions: This article highlights how small changes in quality metric methodology can have a significant impact on measured quality performance, the association between quality performance and utilization-based outcomes, and hospital rankings. These findings highlight the need for standardized quality metric methodologies, better case-mix adjustment and cast further doubt on the use of utilization-based outcomes as quality metrics in chronic diseases.\t\t\n",
      "(0.499)  As population-based payment models become increasingly common, it is crucial to understand how such payment models affect health disparities. We evaluated health care quality and spending among enrollees in areas with lower versus higher socioeconomic status in Massachusetts before and after providers entered into the Alternative Quality Contract, a two-sided population-based payment model with substantial incentives tied to quality. We compared changes in process measures, outcome measures, and spending between enrollees in areas with lower and higher socioeconomic status from 2006 to 2012 (outcome measures were measured after the intervention only). Quality improved for all enrollees in the Alternative Quality Contract after their provider organizations entered the contract. Process measures improved 1.2 percentage points per year more among enrollees in areas with lower socioeconomic status than among those in areas with higher socioeconomic status. Outcome measure improvement was no different between the subgroups; neither were changes in spending. Larger or comparable improvements in quality among enrollees in areas with lower socioeconomic status suggest a potential narrowing of disparities. Strong pay-for-performance incentives within a population-based payment model could encourage providers to focus on improving quality for more disadvantaged populations. \n",

      "(0.603)  Purpose: To use recorded weight values to internally validate weight status and weight change coding in the primary care Electronic Health Record (EHR). Patients and methods: We included adult patients with weight-related Read codes recorded in the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink EHR between 2000 and 2017. Weight status codes were compared to weight values recorded on the same day and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for commonly used codes. Weight change codes were validated using three methods: the percentage (%) difference in kilograms at the time of the code and 1) the previous weight measurement, 2) the weight predicted using linear regression, and 3) the historic mean weight. Weight change codes were validated if estimates were consistent across two out of three methods. Results: A total of 8,108,481 weight codes were recorded in 1,000,002 patients EHR. Twice as many were recorded in females (n=5,208,593, 64%). The mean body mass index for over-weight codes ranged from 31.9 kg/m 2 to 46.9 kg/m 2 and from 17.4 kg/m 2 to 19.2 kg/m 2 for underweight codes. PPVs for the most commonly used weight status codes ranged from 81.3% (80%82.5%) to 99.3% (99.2%99.4%). Across the estimation methods, and using only validated weight change codes, mean weight loss ranged from  5.2% (SD 5.8%) to 7.9% (SD 7.3%) and mean weight gain from 4.2 % (SD 5.5%) to 7.9 % (SD 8.2%). The previous and predicted weight methods were most consistent. Conclusion: We have developed an internationally applicable methodology to internally validate weight-related EHR coding by using available weight measurement data. We demonstrate the UK Read codes that can be confidently used to classify weight status and weight change in the absence of weight values. We provide the first evidence from primary care that a Read code for unexpected weight loss represents a mean loss of = 5 % in a 6-month period, which was broadly consistent across age groups and gender.\t\t\n",
      "(0.598)  Little guidance is available to clinicians on how to talk about weight with their patients. The aim of this study is to explore youth preferences for weight-related conversations. Participants came from the National MyVoice Text Message Cohort. Between 7/2017 and 01/2018, 952 MyVoice participants provided open-ended responses via text message to three questions about weight-related conversations (Has your doctor ever talked to you about weight?, What did he or she say?, and What should a doctor NOT say when talking about weight?). The presence of themes was coded using standard qualitative methods. Of the 952 respondents, 568 (60%) reported that their doctor had talked with them about weight. Of these, 85% indicated that their doctor had notified them of their weight, BMI, or weight status and/or the need to change their body weight and 16% had doctors who provided advice about weight control. Eight themes emerged from the analysis of responses to the question What should a doctor NOT say when talking about weight?. The two most common themes were: (1): Avoid stigmatizing terms/language (32%); and (2) Do not shame patient for their weight (25%). Findings suggest that weight-related conversations do not reflect the preferences of the youth they are designed to benefit. Youth recommended that clinicians focus on health and sustainable behavioral solutions, avoid stigmatizing language and comparing them to others, and be aware of the potential harm associated with making assumptions that conflate weight with health behaviors, morality, or appearance.\t\t\n",
      "(0.582)  Background Finding effective referral policies for weight management services would have important public health implications. Aim Here we compare percentage weight change by referral methods, BMI categories and participants who have had attended weight loss programmes multiple times. Design and settings A prospective cohort study of 15,621 participants referred to 12-week behavioural weight loss programmes funded by the public health service in Birmingham, UK. Methods Comparisons were made between GP versus self-referrals, BMI =40 kg/m2<40 kg/m2 and multiple referrals compared to only one referral. Linear mixed modelling was used to assess percentage weight change after adjusting for covariates. Results Participant's mean age was 48.5 years, 78.7% were of white ethnicity, 90.3% female and mean baseline BMI was 36.3 kg/m2. There were no significant differences in percentage weight loss, between participants that self-referred and those that were referred by their general practitioner (GP) and no significant differences between baseline BMI categories. Referral to a weight loss programme more than once was associated with less weight loss at subsequent attendances (0.92%, 95% CI 0.701.14, p < 0.001). Conclusion Allowing self-referral to a weight loss programme widens access without compromising amount of weight lost. These programmes are beneficial for all categories of obesity, including those with a BMI =40 kg/m2. Attending weight management programmes more than once results in less weight loss and that swapping to a different program may be advisable.\t\t\n",
      "(0.532)  Background: Rapid weight gain is common with antipsychotic medication. Lost confidence, low mood and medication non-adherence often follow. Yet, the dynamic interactions between the physical and psychological consequences of weight gain, and implications for intervention, are unknown. Objectives: We examined first-person accounts of weight gain to identify preferences for weight change interventions. Design: A qualitative design was used to explore patients experiences of weight change in the context of psychosis. Method: Semi-structured interviews, analysed using grounded theory, were conducted with 10 patients with psychosis. Sample validation was conducted with peer researchers with lived experience of psychosis. Results: Patients described that initially the extent and speed of weight gain was overshadowed by psychotic experiences and their treatment. This led to a shocking realisation of weight gain. The psychological impact of weight gain, most strikingly on the self-concept, was profound. Loss of self-worth and changed appearance amplified a sense of vulnerability. There were further consequences on mood, activity and psychotic experiences, such as voices commenting on appearance, that were additional obstacles in the challenging process of weight loss. Sedative effects of medication also contributed. Unsuccessful weight loss left little hope and few preferences for interventions. Early information about common weight gain trajectories and working with experts-by-experience were valued. Rebuilding self-confidence, efficacy and worth may be a necessary first step. Conclusions: The journey of weight gain in patients with psychosis is characterised by loss of self-worth, agency and hope. There are multiple stages in the journey, each with different psychological reactions, that may need different treatment responses.\t\t\n",
      "(0.53)  Background Though many overweight and obese adults attempt to lose weight without formal support, little is known about the strategies used in self-directed weight loss attempts. We set out to assess cognitive and behavioural strategies for weight loss and their associations with weight change. Methods Prospective, web-based cohort study of overweight UK adults (BMI=25kg/m2) trying to lose weight through behaviour change. Strategy use was assessed using the OxFAB questionnaire and evaluated (1) at the domain level, (2) through exploratory factor analysis, and (3) in a model of strategies deemed a priori to be \"essential\" to weight management. Associations with weight change at 3 months were tested using linear regression. Results 486 participants answered all questions; 194 reported weight at baseline and at 3 months (mean weight change -3.3kg (SD 4.1)). Greater weight loss was significantly associated with the motivational support domain (-2.4kg, 95% CI -4.4 to -0.4), dietary impulse control (from factor analysis) (-0.6kg, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.03), and weight loss planning and monitoring (from factor analysis) (-1.3kg, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5). Higher scores in the model of essential behavioural strategies were significantly associated with greater weight loss (compared to participants using 6 or fewer of the 9 strategies, using 7 or more of the 9 strategies was associated with a 2.13kg greater weight loss (SE 0.58, p<0.001)). Conclusions Despite heterogeneity in the strategies employed for weight loss, coherent patterns of behaviours emerged for individual participants, some of which were associated with greater weight loss, including strategies relating to dietary impulse control, weight loss planning and monitoring, motivational support, information seeking and self-monitoring. Trials could test the effect of promoting use of these patterns on weight loss. \n",

      "(0.667)  Pain is a common problem among elite athletes and is frequently associated with sport injury. Both pain and injury interfere with the performance of elite athletes. There are currently no evidence-based or consensus-based guidelines for the management of pain in elite athletes. Typically, pain management consists of the provision of analgesics, rest and physical therapy. More appropriately, a treatment strategy should address all contributors to pain including underlying pathophysiology, biomechanical abnormalities and psychosocial issues, and should employ therapies providing optimal benefit and minimal harm. To advance the development of a more standardised, evidence-informed approach to pain management in elite athletes, an IOC Consensus Group critically evaluated the current state of the science and practice of pain management in sport and prepared recommendations for a more unified approach to this important topic.\t\t\n",
      "(0.619)  Background. Validity of pain recall is questioned in research. Objective. To evaluate the reliability of pain intensity recall for seniors in an emergency department (ED). Methods. This study was part of a prospective multicenter project for seniors (=65 years old) treated in an ED for minor traumatic injury. Pain intensity (0-10 numerical rating scale) was evaluated at the initial ED visit, at one week (baseline), and 3 months. At three months, patients were asked to recall the pain intensity they had at baseline. Results. 482 patients were interviewed (mean age 76.6 years, SD ± 7.3) and 72.8% were female. Intraclass correlation coefficient between pain at baseline and its recall was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.33). Senior patients tended to overestimate their pain intensity by a mean of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9-1.5) units. A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the variance of baseline pain recall at 3 months was explained by pain at ED visit (11%), pain at 3 months (7%), and pain at baseline (2%). Conclusion. The accuracy of pain intensity recall after three months is poor in seniors and seems to be influenced by the pain experienced at the time of injury.\t\t\n",
      "(0.613)  Background: The use of quantitative sensory testing (QST) in multicenter studies has been quite limited, due in part to lack of standardized procedures among centers. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the application of the capsaicin pain model as a surrogate experimental human model of neuropathic pain in different centers and verify the variation in reports of QST measures across centers. Methods: A multicenter study conducted by the Quebec Pain Research Network in six laboratories allowed the evaluation of nine QST parameters in 60 healthy subjects treated with topical capsaicin to model unilateral pain and allodynia. The same measurements (without capsaicin) were taken in 20 patients with chronic neuropathic pain recruited from an independent pain clinic. Results: Results revealed that six parameters detected a significant difference between the capsaicin-treated and the control skin areas: (1) cold detection threshold (CDT) and (2) cold pain threshold (CPT) are lower on the capsaicin-treated side, indicating a decreased in cold sensitivity; (3) heat pain threshold (HPT) was lower on the capsaicin-treated side in healthy subjects, suggesting an increased heat pain sensitivity; (4) dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA); (5) mechanical pain after two stimulations (MPS2); and (6) mechanical pain summation after ten stimulations (MPS10), are increased on the capsaicin-treated side, suggesting an increased in mechanical pain (P < 0.002). CDT, CPT and HPT showed comparable effects across all six centers, with CPT and HPT demonstrating the best sensitivity. Data from the patients showed significant difference between affected and unaffected body side but only with CDT. Conclusion: These results provide further support for the application of QST in multicenter studies examining normal and pathological pain responses.\t\t\n",
      "(0.6)  Background: The prescription of opioids for acute pain may be a driving factor in chronic opioid abuse. We examined patients characteristics associated with the expectation of the receipt of opioid prescriptions for acute pain control. Methods: A 1-time survey was administered to adult patients at family medicine clinics in the Pacific Northwest between November 2018 and January 2019. Logistic regression modeled adjusted odds of expecting an opioid prescription in = 3 of the 4 dispositional acute pain scenarios by patient demographics, opioid use, past-week pain intensity and duration, past-week anxiety, and pain catastrophizing. Results: The survey was completed by 108 patients (62% female, 48% between 30 and 49 years of age, 75% non-Hispanic Whites). Most patients (71%) expected an opioid prescription in = 1 of the 4 scenarios; 26% expected a prescription in = 3 scenarios. Patients with higher levels of pain catastrophizing had more than 3 times greater odds of expecting opioids than those with lower pain catastrophizing (OR, 3.73; P = .032; 95% CI, 1.12-12.46); no other characteristics were statistically significant. Conclusion: Higher pain catastrophizing was associated with increased odds of expecting opioids in dispositional acute pain scenarios in outpatient settings. Future studies can determine whether addressing pain catastrophizing reduces expectations of opioid prescribing for acute pain control. The finding that most patients expected opioid prescriptions in acute pain scenarios needs further exploration into other potential factors associated with these expectations. Evidence-based guidelines for condition-specific acute pain management are warranted for appropriate opioid prescribing and to guide treatment expectations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.583)  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to estimate the association between pain and the number, severity, and location of fractures in women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Method: We used an 11-point numeric pain rating scale to assess pain during movement in the preceding week and lateral spinal radiographs to confirm number, location, and severity of vertebral fractures. In model 1, we assessed the association between pain during movement and the number, severity, and location of fractures. We adjusted model 2 for pain medication use and age. Results: The mean age of participants was 76.4 (SD 6.9) years. We found no statistically significant associations between pain and fracture number (estimated ß = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.68), fracture severity (estimated ß = 0.46, 95% CI: 1.38, 0.49), or fracture location at T4T8 (estimated ß = 0.06, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.34), T9L1 (estimated ß = 0.35, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.74), or L2L4 (estimated ß = 0.40, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.75). Age and pain medication use were not significantly associated with pain. Model 1 accounted for 4.7% and model 2 for 7.2% of the variance in self-reported pain. Conclusion: The number, location, and severity of fractures do not appear to be the primary explanation for pain in women with vertebral fractures. Clinicians must consider other factors contributing to pain. \n",

      "(0.681)  Key scholars have lauded benefits of integrating mixed methods and grounded theoryor mixed methodsgrounded theory (MM-GT)yet there have been few attempts to ascertain in what ways researchers use MM-GT. Our aim was to systematically, but not exhaustively, examine applications of MM-GT and offer procedural guidelines. We identified 61 empirical MM-GT articles and developed a codebook for analysis. MM-GT was widely used across disciplines. Most published MM-GT provided little methodological detail regarding grounded theory, mixed methods, and their integration; theoretical development was noticeably absent; and the majority followed a convergent mixed methods design. This inquiry contributes to emerging discussions regarding the ways in which MM-GT can or should be used to more fully realize the potential of this approach.\t\t\n",
      "(0.595)  Background: Qualitative research methods are increasingly being used across disciplines because of their ability to help investigators understand the perspectives of participants in their own words. However, qualitative analysis is a laborious and resource-intensive process. To achieve depth, researchers are limited to smaller sample sizes when analyzing text data. One potential method to address this concern is natural language processing (NLP). Qualitative text analysis involves researchers reading data, assigning code labels, and iteratively developing findings; NLP has the potential to automate part of this process. Unfortunately, little methodological research has been done to compare automatic coding using NLP techniques and qualitative coding, which is critical to establish the viability of NLP as a useful, rigorous analysis procedure. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of a traditional qualitative text analysis, an NLP analysis, and an augmented approach that combines qualitative and NLP methods. Methods: We conducted a 2-arm cross-over experiment to compare qualitative and NLP approaches to analyze data generated through 2 text (short message service) message survey questions, one about prescription drugs and the other about police interactions, sent to youth aged 14-24 years. We randomly assigned a question to each of the 2 experienced qualitative analysis teams for independent coding and analysis before receiving NLP results. A third team separately conducted NLP analysis of the same 2 questions. We examined the results of our analyses to compare (1) the similarity of findings derived, (2) the quality of inferences generated, and (3) the time spent in analysis. Results: The qualitative-only analysis for the drug question (n=58) yielded 4 major findings, whereas the NLP analysis yielded 3 findings that missed contextual elements. The qualitative and NLP-augmented analysis was the most comprehensive. For the police question (n=68), the qualitative-only analysis yielded 4 primary findings and the NLP-only analysis yielded 4 slightly different findings. Again, the augmented qualitative and NLP analysis was the most comprehensive and produced the highest quality inferences, increasing our depth of understanding (ie, details and frequencies). In terms of time, the NLP-only approach was quicker than the qualitative-only approach for the drug (120 vs 270 minutes) and police (40 vs 270 minutes) questions. An approach beginning with qualitative analysis followed by qualitative- or NLP-augmented analysis took longer time than that beginning with NLP for both drug (450 vs 240 minutes) and police (390 vs 220 minutes) questions. Conclusions: NLP provides both a foundation to code qualitatively more quickly and a method to validate qualitative findings. NLP methods were able to identify major themes found with traditional qualitative analysis but were not useful in identifying nuances. Traditional qualitative text analysis added important details and context.\t\t\n",

      "(0.537)  BACKGROUND: Given the history of unethical research in Indigenous communities, there is often apprehension among Indigenous communities toward research carried out by non-Indigenous researchers. We examined the approaches, experiences and motivations among non-Indigenous researchers at a research-intensive Canadian university conducting research with Indigenous communities to understand approaches to ethical research with Indigenous peoples. METHODS: We performed a critical constructivist qualitative study incorporating decolonizing methodologies. We conducted semistructured interviews with 8 non-Indigenous University of Toronto researchers with a research focus/interest related to Indigenous health between August and October 2017. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed through an iterative process. Shared experiences among the researchers were arranged into primary themes. RESULTS: We identified 4 primary themes related to the conduct of Indigenous research by non-Indigenous researchers: 1) relationships with communities are foundational to the research process, 2) non-Indigenous researchers experience a personal self-reflective journey grounded in reconciliation, allyship and privilege, 3) accepted knowledge frameworks in Indigenous research are familiar to most but are inconsistently applied and 4) institutions act as barriers to and facilitators of ethical conduct of Indigenous research. Four core principles - relationships, trust, humility and accountability - unified the primary themes. INTERPRETATION: We identified strengths and areas for improvement of current policies and practices in Indigenous research by non-Indigenous researchers. Although non-Indigenous researchers value relationships, and their research is informed by Indigenous knowledge, institutional barriers to implementing recommended elements exist, and certain policy statements such as the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2 lack applicability to secondary data analysis for some non-Indigenous researchers.\t\t\n",
      "(0.531)  Mixed methods research is growing in use throughout countries and disciplines. Consequently, more people are learning methodology and providing training. Yet, only a paucity of empirical studies addresses the topic of teaching and learning mixed methods. Our current understanding of how to distinguish novices from experts at mixed methods, an important question for instructors and mentors, is anecdotal. While related literature tends to focus on teaching mixed methods research, this study took a different perspective. I used a proficiency framework to explore the skills needed to conduct mixed methods research as identified by experienced researchers, mixed methods curricula, and the mixed methods literature and to develop a typology of mixed methods proficiency. Data collection involved multiple data sources: qualitative interviews (n = 8) with individuals highly regarded for their expertise in mixed methods research and documents in the form of course syllabi, curricula materials, and workshop materials. I then conducted theme-based and type-building text analysis of the data. Four themes emerged: mixed methods skills, knowledge, researcher characteristics, and professional experiences. This article presents a typology of descriptors at three levels of mixed methods proficiency: novices, researchers, and methodologists. The proficiency typology and resultant understanding of what distinguishes mixed methods experts will be useful to learners, instructors, and mentors in developing courses, workshops, and professional development plans. \n",

The objective of this research was to understand how clinical researchers of different skill levels include variables in a case report form for their clinical research. Setting The setting for this research was a major academic institution in Beijing, China. Participants The target population was clinical researchers with three levels of experience, namely, limited clinical research experience, clinicians with rich clinical research experience and clinical research experts. Methods Using a qualitative approach, we conducted 13 individual interviews (face to face) and one group interview (n=4) with clinical researchers from June to September 2016. Based on maximum variation sampling to identify researchers with three levels of research experience: eight clinicians with limited clinical research experience, five clinicians with rich clinical research experience and four clinical research experts. These 17 researchers had diverse hospital-based medical specialties and or specialisation in clinical research. Results Our analysis yields a typology of three processes developing a case report form that varies according to research experience level. Novice clinician researchers often have an incomplete protocol or none at all, and conduct data collection and publication based on a general framework. Experienced clinician researchers include variables in the case report form based on previous experience with attention to including domains or items at risk for omission and by eliminating unnecessary variables. Expert researchers consider comprehensively in advance data collection and implementation needs and plan accordingly. Conclusion These results illustrate increasing levels of sophistication in research planning that increase sophistication in selection for variables in the case report form. These findings suggest that novice and intermediate-level researchers could benefit by emulating the comprehensive planning procedures such as those used by expert clinical researchers.\t\t\n",

      "(0.556)  Introduction Emergency medicine (EM) has a high case turnover and acuity making it a demanding clinical reasoning domain especially for junior doctors who lack experience. We aimed to better understand their clinical reasoning using dual cognition as a guiding theory. Methods EM junior doctors were recruited from six hospitals in the south of England to participate in semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus groups (n=17) based on recall of two recent cases. Transcripts were analysed using a grounded theory approach to identify themes and to develop a model of junior doctors' clinical reasoning in EM. Results Within cases, clinical reasoning occurred in three phases. In phase 1 (case framing), initial case cues and first impressions were predominantly intuitive, but checked by analytical thought and determined the urgency of clinical assessment. In phase 2 (evolving reasoning), non-analytical single cue and pattern recognitions were common which were subsequently validated by specific analytical strategies such as use of red flags. In phase 3 (ongoing uncertainty) analytical self-monitoring and reassurance strategies were used to precipitate a decision regarding discharge. Conclusion We found a constant dialectic between intuitive and analytical cognition throughout the reasoning process. Our model of clinical reasoning by EM junior doctors illustrates the specific contextual manifestations of the dual cognition theory. Distinct diagnostic strategies are identified and together these give EM learners and educators a framework and vocabulary for discussion and learning about clinical reasoning.\t\t\n",
      "(0.543)  Background: Clinical academic nursing roles are rare, and clinical academic leadership positions even more scarce. Amongst the United Kingdom (UK) academia, only 3% of nurses who are employed within universities are clinically active. Furthermore, access to research fellowships and research grant funding for nurses in clinical or academic practice is also limited. The work of Florence Nightingale, the original role model for clinical academic nursing, is discussed in terms of how this has shaped and influenced that of clinical academic nurse leaders in modern UK healthcare settings. We analysed case studies with a view to providing exemplars and informing a new model by which to visualise a trajectory of clinical academic careers. Methods: A Framework analysis of seven exemplar cases was conducted for a network of Clinical Academic Nursing Professors (n = 7), using a structured template. Independent analysis highlighted shared features of the roles: (a) model of clinical academic practice, (b) infrastructure for the post, (c) capacity-building initiatives, (d) strategic influence, (e) wider influence, (f) local and national implementation initiatives, (g) research area and focus and (h) impact and contribution. Findings: All seven of the professors of nursing involved in this discourse were based in both universities and healthcare organisations in an equal split. All had national and international profiles in their specialist clinical areas and were implementing innovation in their clinical and teaching settings through boundary spanning. We outline a model for career trajectories in clinical academia, and how leadership is crucial. Conclusion: The model outlined emphasises the different stages of clinical academic roles in nursing. Nursing as a discipline needs to embrace the value of these roles, which have great potential to raise the standards of healthcare and the status of the profession. \n",

      "(0.563)  Background: Understanding factors that influence public support for nudging policies, like pictorial cigarette pack warnings, may offer insight about how to increase such support. We sought to examine factors that influence smokers support for requiring pictorial warnings on cigarette packs. Methods: In 2014 and 2015, we randomly assigned 2149 adult US smokers to receive either pictorial warnings or text-only warnings on their cigarette packs for 4 weeks. The outcome examined in the current study was support for a policy requiring pictorial warnings on cigarette packs in the US. Results: Support for pictorial warnings was high at baseline (mean: 3.2 out of 4). Exposure to pictorial warnings increased policy support at week 4 (ß = .05, p = .03). This effect was explained by increases in perceived message effectiveness (p < .001) and reported conversations about policy support (p < .001). Message reactance (i.e., an oppositional reaction to the warning) partially diminished the impact of pictorial warnings on policy support (p < .001). Conclusions: Exposing people to a new policy through implementation could increase public support for that policy by increasing perceived effectiveness and by prompting conversations about the policy. Reactance may partially weaken the effect of policy exposure on public support.\t\t\n",
      "(0.537)  Despite the importance of public opinion for policy formation and the political salience of inequality, the public's views about the desirability of equality, not only in health but also in economics and politics, has attracted little attention. We report the results of an on-line survey administered in late 2016 in Great Britain (N = 1667 with a response rate of 3550%). The survey allowed for testing the sensitivity of public opinion across two other variables: absolute versus relative (everyone should have the same versus inequality should be reduced) and bivariate versus univariate (inequality in one domain is judged in relation to inequality in another versus inequality in a domain is judged independently of other domains). It also allowed examination of how far support for equality in one domain overlaps with support for equality in another. We find that for health, economic and political equality a relative conception of equality attracts more support than an absolute conception, and that for health and political equality a bivariate conception attracts more support than a univariate conception. We also find that conceptions of equality affect how much overlap exists between support for different forms of equality, with a bivariate and relative conception resulting in more overlap than a univariate and absolute conception. We also find evidence for Walzer's complex equality theory in which people tolerate inequality in one domain if it does not control inequality in another.\t\t\n",
      "(0.512)  People bereaved by suicide are at increased risk of suicide, but evidence is lacking that available interventions reduce suicide risk. Few large-scale studies have described the views of suicide-bereaved people regarding their needs for support. Our objective was to explore the nature of young adults experiences of support after bereavement by suicide and their views on valued and unhelpful aspects. We conducted a cross-sectional study of staff and students aged 18-40 at 37 United Kingdom (UK) higher educational institutions in 2010, eliciting qualitative responses to two questions probing experiences of support and unmet needs after the suicide of a close contact. We conducted thematic analysis of responses from 420 adults bereaved by suicide, of whom 75% had received support after the loss. We identified three broad descriptive areas corresponding to important aspects of support: value and experiences of the support received; views on specific support needs; and reasons for not seeking support. We found that needs for emotional support exist throughout the social networks of people who die by suicide but are often hidden. Our findings suggest a need for proactive offers of support from family, friends, and professionals after suicide, repeated regularly in case a bereaved person does not feel ready for support early on.\t\t\n",
      "(0.485)  Objective: Peer support centers are an ideal setting where people with severe mental illnesses can access the Internet via computers for online health education, peer support, and behavioral treatments. The purpose of this study was to assess computer use and Internet access in peer support agencies. Method: A peer-assisted survey assessed the frequency with which consumers in all 13 New Hampshire peer support centers (n - 702) used computers to access Internet resources. During the 30-day survey period, 200 of the 702 peer support consumers (28%) responded to the survey. Results: More than 3 quarters (78.5%) of respondents had gone online to seek information in the past year. About half (49%) of respondents were interested in learning about online forums that would provide information and peer support for mental health issues. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Peer support centers may be a useful venue for Web-based approaches to education, peer support, and intervention. Future research should assess facilitators and barriers to use of Web-based resources among people with severe mental illness in peer support centers. \n",

      "(0.603)  Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, with the need for 'strong action' highlighted by the Chief Medical Officer for England in 2013, along with a 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy. Objectives: Five years on, we set out to determine if there was a measurable impact from the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy on overall antibiotic prescribing in NHS primary care in England. Methods: We calculated the volume of antibiotic prescription items using annual prescription cost analysis data from 1998 to 2017 and monthly prescribing data from October 2010 to June 2018. Antibiotic prescribing rate was calculated using an age- and sex-adjusted denominator (Specific Therapeutic group Age-sex Related Prescribing Units, STAR-PU). We conducted interrupted time series analysis to measure any change in prescribing rate after the intervention. Results: After several years with a stable rate of antibiotic prescribing, there was a downward change in gradient after 2013: -46.4 items per 1000 STAR-PU per year (95% CI=-61.4 to -31.3). The prescribing rate dropped from 1378 per 1000 STAR-PU per year in 2013 to 1184 in 2017, representing a 14.1% reduction. The reduction is similar for monthly data (16.4%). Assuming causality, when compared with predicted prescribing if the rate of prescribing had continued at the pre-2013 trend, we estimate that 9.7 million antibiotic prescriptions were prevented over the past year by the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy. Conclusions: Though we cannot firmly attribute causality for the reduction in prescribing to the 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy, the magnitude and timing of the change are noteworthy; the substantial change followed a long period of relatively static antibiotic prescribing.\t\t\n",
      "(0.575)  Background: Between-country differences have been described in antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infection (RTI) in primary care, but not yet for diagnostic testing procedures and prescribing confidence. Aim: To describe between-country differences in RTI management, particularly diagnostic testing and antibiotic prescribing, and investigate which factors relate to antibiotic prescribing and GPs prescribing confidence. Design & setting: Prospective audit in 18 European countries. Method: An audit of GP-registered patient, clinical, and management characteristics for patients presenting with sore throat and/or lower RTI (n = 4982), and GPs' confidence in their antibiotic prescribing decision. Factors related to antibiotic prescribing and confidence were analysed using multi-level logistic regression. Results: Antibiotic prescribing proportions varied considerably: <20% in four countries, and >40% in six countries. There was also considerable variation in point-of care (POC) testing (0% in Croatia, Moldova, and Romania, and >65% in Denmark and Norway, mainly for C-reactive protein [CRP] and group A streptococcal [strep A] infection), and in laboratory or hospital-based testing (<3% in Hungary, the Netherlands, and Spain, and >30% in Croatia, Georgia, Greece, and Moldova, mainly chest X-ray and white blood cell counting). Antibiotic prescribing was related to illness severity, comorbidity, age, fever, and country, but not to having performed a POC test. In nearly 90% of consultations, GPs were confident in their antibiotic prescribing decision. Conclusion: Despite high confidence in decisions about antibiotic prescribing, there is considerable variation in the primary care of RTI in European countries, with GPs prescribing antibiotics overall more often than is considered appropriate. POC testing may enhance the quality of antibiotic prescribing decisions if it can safely reverse decisions confidently made on clinical grounds alone to prescribe\t\t\n",
      "(0.552)  Background Most antibiotics are prescribed in primary care. Locum or sessional GPs (locums) are perceived as contributing to higher prescribing and may face barriers to engaging with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Aim To identify how locums antibiotic prescribing compares with other general practice prescribers, and how they perceive their role in antibiotic prescribing and AMS. Design and setting Mixed-methods study in primary care. Method Data on antibiotic prescribing, diagnoses, and patient and prescriber characteristics were extracted from The Health Improvement Network database. A mixed-effects logistic model was used to compare locums and other prescribers antibiotic prescribing for conditions that do not usually benefit from antibiotics. Nineteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with locums in England and analysed thematically. Results Locums accounted for 11% of consultations analysed. They prescribed antibiotics more often than other GPs and nurse prescribers for acute cough, sore throat, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, and acute bronchitis. The number of patients receiving antibiotics for these conditions was 4% higher (on absolute scale) when consulting with locums compared with when they consulted with other GPs. Four themes capture the perceived influences on prescribing antibiotics and AMS: antibiotic prescribing as a complex but individual issue, nature and patterns of locum work, relationships between practices and locums, and professional isolation. Conclusion Locums contribute to higher antibiotic prescribing compared with their peers. They experience challenges but also opportunities for contributing to AMS, which should be better addressed. With an increasing proportion of locums in general practice, they have an important role in antibiotic optimisation and AMS.\t\t\n",
      "(0.55)  Reducing antibiotic overuse is a key NHS priority. The majority of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care. Objectives: To describe antibiotic prescribing trends in NHS England primary care for the years 1998-2017 using various measures. We investigated trends and variation between practices and geographical areas, out-of-hours prescribing, and seasonality. Methods: We used publicly available prescribing datasets and calculated antibiotic prescribing rates per 1000 age-sex-adjusted population units, percentage prescribed as broad-spectrum, and course length.We report national time trends for 1998-2016, geographical variation across 2017 and variation trends for 2010-17. We calculated percentiles and ranges, and plotted maps. Results: The overall rate of antibiotic prescribing has reduced by 18% since 2010, with the steepest decline since 2013. The percentage prescribed as broad-spectrum declined since 2006, from 18.0 to 8.4. Between the best and worst Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) there was 2-fold variation for total antibiotic prescribing, but 7- fold variation for cephalosporins. Variation across general practices has declined. The CCG to which a practice belongs accounted for 12.6% of current variation (P,0.0001). Higher antibiotic prescribing was associated with greater practice size, proportion of patients .65 years or ,18 years, ruralness and deprivation. Seasonal increases have been declining for most antibiotics. If every practice prescribed antibiotics at the lowest decile rate in 2017, 10.8 million fewer prescriptions could have been issued (34%). Compared with standard practices, out-of-hours practices prescribed a greater proportion of broad-spectrumantibiotics. Conclusions: Despite a general trend towards more optimal antibiotic prescribing, considerable geographical variation persists across England's practices and CCGs.\t\t\n",
      "(0.518)  Aim: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial prescribing in general practice for children aged =18 years. Methods: This is a review of routinely collected patient data extracted from computerised medical records from 39 general practices in eastern metropolitan Melbourne over a 5-year period, 20102014. Main outcome measures: Proportion of paediatric consultations resulting in antibiotic prescription, type and frequency of antibiotics prescribed, antibiotic prescribing stratified by age, reason for indication and inter-practice variation. Results: There were 744 883 consultations for 89 983 individual paediatric patients and 85 913 prescriptions for antibiotics during the study period. Of these antibiotic prescriptions, 75 410 were associated with a consultation, and 10 503 (12.2% of all prescriptions) had no associated consultation in the data. On average, one in five individual children was prescribed an antibiotic each year. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cephalexin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, phenoxymethylpenicillin and roxithromycin. Less than 3% of all prescriptions were for amoxycillin. Prescribing of cefaclor and roxithromycin decreased, although cefaclor remained the third most common antibiotic choice for general practitioners. Peaks in prescribing were noted over winter months. Reason for prescription was not recorded for 82% of prescriptions. The frequency of antibiotic prescription per consultation varied substantially (2.119.7%) between general practitioner clinics. Overall, antibiotic prescribing decreased by 2.3% over the 5-year period. Conclusions: This study provides a focused examination of antibiotic prescribing practices for children in Australian general practice. More information is required to better understand specific prescribing practices in children, including the low frequency of amoxycillin prescription and ongoing prescription of cefaclor. \n",

      "(0.598)  This study analyses the changes in mental health in the UK that occurred as a result of the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the EU (Brexit). Using the Household Longitudinal Study, we compare the levels of self-reported mental distress, mental functioning and life satisfaction be-fore and after the referendum. A linear fixed effects analysis revealed an overall decrease in mental health post-referendum with higher levels of mental distress, and a decline in the SF-12 Mental Component Summary score. Furthermore, the study does not find evidence of significant changes in overall life satisfaction in the two years after the referendum. Younger men, highly educated and Natives, especially those living in stronger Remain areas, seem to be the groups most affected by the Brexit in terms of mental health. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the outcome of the referendum and the economic uncertainty that it brought impacted the mental health of voters in a negative and diverging way.\t\t\n",
      "(0.549)  Congress and many state legislatures are considering expanding access to telemedicine. To inform this debate, we analyzed Medicare fee-for-service claims for the period 2004-14 to understand trends in and recent use of telemedicine for mental health care, also known as telemental health. The study population consisted of rural beneficiaries with a diagnosis of any mental illness or serious mental illness. The number of telemental health visits grew on average 45.1 percent annually, and by 2014 there were 5.3 and 11.8 telemental health visits per 100 rural beneficiaries with any mental illness or serious mental illness, respectively. There was notable variation across states: In 2014 nine had more than twenty-five visits per 100 beneficiaries with serious mental illness, while four states and the District of Columbia had none. Compared to other beneficiaries with mental illness, beneficiaries who received a telemental health visit were more likely to be younger than sixty-five, be eligible for Medicare because of disability, and live in a relatively poor community. States with a telemedicine parity law and a pro-telemental health regulatory environment had significantly higher rates of telemental health use than those that did not.\t\t\n",
      "(0.526)  In the previous accompanying paper, we described geopolitical factors which affect mental health of individuals who suffer directly and indirectly. These disasters whether they are natural or man-made often attract significant amounts of aid and resources  financial and human. In addition, those who offer foreign aid need to be aware of where and how the aid is being spent. In this paper, we propose that aid giving agencies give due attention to the impact the aid should have on mental health of recipients. Global mental health has become a movement, but concerns remain about its efficacy. Therefore, it is imperative that any aid given is given and utilised in a culturally appropriate and culturally sensitive way. In an interconnected and interlinked world, it is likely that when one country or nation is affected by disasters or trauma, it will impact upon others around both directly and indirectly. We present a new measurement tool-CAPE Vulnerability Index which can be used to identify most vulnerable communities so that international aid may be more appropriately targeted. We believe that this index may go some way in assisting governments and policymakers in ascertaining the impact of their aid on the emotional and mental health of individuals. We suggest that their needs to be a ring-fencing of aid to ensure that population mental health is protected and enhanced with a strategic approach inbuilt into the foreign policy the focus needs to shift towards public mental health.\t\t\n",

It deals with the epidemiology of mental disorders, their treatment options, mental health education, the structure of mental healthcare systems and human rights issues. Specifically, this paper focuses on community-based mental health approaches that may be useful for marginalized and excluded populations, for example, frail elderly, francophone minorities and refugees. We explore the delivery of mental health support and care, psychoeducation, narrative therapies and trauma-informed approaches for these populations. We focus on lay persons, peer workers and community-based primary care practitioners and shared mental healthcare workers. We provide examples of these approaches and therapies and explore the central role of narrative approaches and proximity of care.\t\t\n",
      "(0.49)  METHOD: A questionnaire survey was conducted among GPs. Of the 516 respondents, 76 (14.7%) had attended a one-year postgraduate mental health training course. RESULTS: The GPs with mental health training saw significantly more patients with mental health problems per week (median class 11-15 versus 6-10) and treated a higher percentage of patients with mental health problems (median class 41-60% versus 21-40%). The differences remained significant, with odds ratios of 2.6 for both indicators after controlling for gender, healthcare setting and years of practice. DISCUSSION: Policies should promote training of GPs as part of the increasing workforce for mental healthcare. Estimated from the results, GPs with mental health training have nearly triple the number of consultations related to mental health, compared with other GPs (340 versus 120 per year). \n",

      "(0.562)  Background Hospital patients who use illicit opioids such as heroin may use drugs during an admission or leave the hospital in order to use drugs. There have been reports of patients found dead from drug poisoning on the hospital premises or shortly after leaving the hospital. This study examines whether hospital admission and discharge are associated with increased risk of opioid-related death. Methods and findings We conducted a case-crossover study of opioid-related deaths in England. Our study included 13,609 deaths between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 among individuals aged 18 to 64. For each death, we sampled 5 control days from the period 730 to 28 days before death. We used data from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database to determine the time proximity of deaths and control days to hospital admissions. We estimated the association between hospital admission and opioid-related death using conditional logistic regression, with a reference category of time neither admitted to the hospital nor within 14 days of discharge. A total of 236/13,609 deaths (1.7%) occurred following drug use while admitted to the hospital. The risk during hospital admissions was similar or lower than periods neither admitted to the hospital nor recently discharged, with odds ratios 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; p = 0.75) for the first 14 days of an admission and 0.41 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.56; p < 0.001) for days 15 onwards. 1,088/13,609 deaths (8.0%) occurred in the 14 days after discharge. The risk of opioid-related death increased in this period, with odds ratios of 4.39 (95% CI 3.75 to 5.14; p < 0.001) on days 1 to 2 after discharge and 2.09 (95% CI 1.92 to 2.28; p < 0.001) on days 3 to 14. 11,629/13,609 deaths (85.5%) did not occur close to a hospital admission, and the remaining 656/13,609 deaths (4.8%) occurred in hospital following admission due to drug poisoning. Risk was greater for patients discharged from psychiatric admissions, those who left the hospital against medical advice, and those leaving the hospital after admissions of 7 days or more. The main limitation of the method is that it does not control for time-varying health or drug use within individuals; therefore, hospital admissions coinciding with high-risk periods may in part explain the results. Conclusions Discharge from the hospital is associated with an acute increase in the risk of opioid-related death, and 1 in 14 opioid-related deaths in England happens in the 2 weeks after the hospital discharge. This supports interventions that prevent early discharge and improve linkage with community drug treatment and harm reduction services.\t\t\n",
      "(0.442)  Background: Accidental acetaminophen overdoses are associated with substantial morbidity and health care costs. In Canada, updated labelling standards were implemented in October 2009 and September 2016, with the intent of communicating risks of overdose and facilitating product identification and safe use, respectively. Full compliance with the 2016 standards was expected by March 2018. We sought to explore whether these changes affected rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of hospital admissions for accidental acetaminophen overdose in 9 Canadian provinces and 3 Canadian territories between Apr. 1, 2004, and Mar. 31, 2020. We used interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to evaluate the impact of the updated labelling standards on rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose. In secondary analyses, we studied intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and hospital admissions for accidental acetaminophen overdose involving opioids. Results: Monthly rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose were essentially unchanged over the study period (0.21 and 0.22 cases per 100000 population in April 2004 and March 2020, respectively). We found no association between changing labelling standards and trends in rates of hospital admission for accidental acetaminophen overdose (October 2009 p = 0.2, September 2016 p = 0.7 and March 2018 p = 0.2). Similarly, labelling changes did not have an impact on admissions involving ICU admission and concomitant opioid poisoning.\t\t\n",
      "(0.427)  The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) has penalized hospitals with higher 30-day readmission rates more than $3 billion to date. Clinicians and policy experts have raised concerns that the 30-day readmission measure used in this program provides an incomplete picture of performance because it does not capture all hospital encounters that may occur after discharge. In contrast, the excess days in acute care (EDAC) measure, which currently is not used in the HRRP, captures the full spectrum of hospital encounters (emergency department, observation stay, inpatient readmission) and their associated lengths of stay within 30 days of discharge. This study of 3173 hospitals that participated in the HRRP in fiscal year 2019 compared performance on the readmission and EDAC measures and evaluated whether using the EDAC measure would change hospitals' penalty status for 3 conditions targeted by the HRRP. Overall, only moderate agreement was found on hospital performance rankings by using the readmission and EDAC measures (weighted _ statistic: Heart failure, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.47]; acute myocardial infarction [AMI], 0.37 [CI, 0.35 to 0.40]; and pneumonia, 0.50 [CI, 0.47 to 0.52]). Under the HRRP, the penalty status of 769 (27.0%) of 2845 hospitals for heart failure, 581 (28.3%) of 2055 for AMI, and 724 (24.9%) of 2911 for pneumonia would change if the EDAC measure were used instead of the readmission measure to evaluate performance. Fewer small and rural hospitals would receive penalties. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should consider using the EDAC measure, which provides a more comprehensive picture of postdischarge hospital use, rather than the 30-day readmission measure to evaluate health care system performance under federal quality, reporting, and value-based programs.\t\t\n",
      "(0.393)  Background: There are approximately 5200 community hospitals in the United States. About 1300 of them are investor-owned, for-profit hospitals whose owners are corporations, groups of physicians, or other private entities. Private equity firms use capital from individuals and institutions to invest in organizations. They are increasingly buying hospitals, which they typically plan to sell for a profit within 3 to 7 years after acquisition (1, 2). A recent study evaluated changes in hospital income, use, and quality associated with private equity acquisitions between 2005 and 2017 (2). Objective: To compare acute care hospitals owned by private equity firms with similarly sized and located hospitals not owned by private equity firms in 2018. Methods and Findings: We used merger and acquisition reports by Irving Levin Associates and public information to identify 130 hospitals under private equity control in 2018. We then identified all 2868 hospitals that had a full year of data in the 2018 Medicare Cost Report, extracted information on size (1 to 49 beds, 50 to 450 beds, and =451 beds), and assigned the hospitals to health care markets (hospital referral regions) using The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. We used health care markets and size groups to identify 688 hospitals that we could match to a private equity hospital. Within matched groups, there were 1 to 56 matched control hospitals per private equity hospital, with a median of 8 control hospitals and an interquartile range of 10. We assigned each private equity hospital a weight of 1 and assigned its matched hospitals' weights that summed to 1. We used these weights in all analyses.\t\t\n",
      "(0.39)  Background: Pneumococcal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We use routine hospital admissions data and time-series modelling analysis to estimate the impact of the seven and thirteen valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) on hospital admissions due to pneumococcal disease in England. Methods: Hospital admissions for pneumococcal meningitis, bacteraemia and pneumonia between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2015 were identified from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database for all age groups in England. We model the impact of pneumococcal vaccination using interrupted time series analysis. Hospital admissions prior to vaccine introduction were extrapolated to predict the expected number of admissions in the absence of pneumococcal vaccines. Admissions avoided over time were estimated by comparing the fitted interrupted time series and the expected model for no vaccination in a Bayesian framework. Results: Overall, there were 43,531 (95% credible interval (CrI): 36486-51,346) fewer hospital admissions due to bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia in England during the period from 2006 to 2015 than would have been expected if pneumococcal vaccines had not been implemented, with the majority of hospital admissions avoided due to pneumonia. Among young children reductions in meningitis were more common, while among adults reductions in pneumonia admissions were relatively more important, with no evidence for reduced bacteraemia and meningitis among older adults. We estimated that 981 (95% CrI: 391-2018), 749 (95% CrI: 295-1442) and 1464 (95% CrI: 793-2522) bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia related hospital admissions, respectively, were averted in children < 2 years of age. Conclusions: Substantial reductions in hospital admissions for bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia in England were estimated after the introduction of childhood vaccination, with indirect effects being responsible for most of the hospital admissions avoided. \n",

      "(0.557)  Purpose: Little is known about the views of U.S. youth on COVID-19 or their use of face coverings. Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. Methods: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 1424 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. Results: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. Conclusions: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.\t\t\n",

Several nations have indicated that if there is a compelling case for use of a vaccine before it is licensed, they would be prepared to authorise its emergency use or conditional approval on public health grounds. As of Dec 1, 2020, several developers of leading COVID-19 candidate vaccines have indicated that they have applied, or intend to apply, for emergency authorisation for their vaccines. Should candidate vaccines attain emergency use designation and be programmatically deployed before their phase 3 trials conclude, such a strategy could have far reaching consequences for COVID-19 vaccine research and the effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To maximize the uptake and reach of this promising strategy and inform intervention development and scale up, research is needed to understand the acceptability of and willingness to use this tool. This is vital to ensure that Black/African Americans are reached by the Biden-Harris Administrations free national COVID-19 ST program. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and recommendations to promote and scale-up the uptake of COVID-19 ST among Black/African Americans. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study using a semi-structured questionnaire to assess barriers and facilitators to the uptake of COVID-19 ST among a convenience sample of 28 self-identified Black/African Americans from schools, community centers, and faith-based institutions in Ohio and Maryland. Inductive content analysis was conducted to identify categories and subcategories related to acceptability and recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST in communities. Results: Participants perceived COVID-19 self-testing as an acceptable tool that is beneficial to prevent transmission and address some of the barriers associated with health facility testing, such as transportation cost and human contact at the health facility. However, concerns were raised regarding the accurate use of the kits and costs. Recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST included engagement of community stakeholders to disseminate information about COVID-19 self-testing and creating culturally appropriate education tools to promote knowledge of and clear instructions about how to properly use COVID-19 ST kits. Based on these recommendations, the COVID-19 STEP (Self-Testing Education and Promotion) Project is being developed and will involve engaging community partners such as barbers, church leaders, and other community-based organizations to increase the uptake and use of free COVID-19 ST kits among Black/African Americans. Conclusion: Findings showed that most participants considered COVID-19 ST valuable for encouraging COVID-19 testing. However, cost and accuracy concerns may pose barriers. Future work should consider implementing interventions that leverage the benefits of COVID-19 ST and further assess the extent to which these identified facilitators and barriers may influence COVID-19 ST uptake.\t\t\n",
      "(0.452)  Objective: This study was aimed to assess the perceived fear of COVID-19 and its associated factors among older adults in Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2020 among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults aged =60 years. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants characteristics and COVID-19 related information. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), where the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with perceived fear of COVID-19. Results: The mean fear score was 19.4. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 (ß: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.78) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 (ß: 3.31, 95% CI: 2.33 to 4.29) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Moreover, older adults who felt themselves isolated from others and whose close friends and family members were diagnosed with COVID-19 were more fearful. However, the participants who received COVID-19 related information from the health workers had a lower level of fear (ß: -1.90, 95% CI: - 3.06 to - 0.73). Conclusions: The presence of overwhelming fear of COVID-19 among the older adults of Bangladesh underlines the psychological needs of these vulnerable groups. Health workers have a key role in addressing these needs and further research is needed to identify the effective strategies for them to use.\t\t\n",
      "(0.452)  Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of nonessential businesses have been central to COVID19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases and deaths, and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses. \n",

Materials and methods: We conducted a non-randomized study evaluating treatment data for patients in outpatient treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) at a private clinic. Patients who were HCV-positive, had been in OUD treatment for at least 4 weeks, and engaged in integrated HCV treatment with DAA (co-located within their treatment for OUD) were compared to patients with HCV who only received OUD treatment. We evaluated HCV cure; OUD medication adherence, treatment utilization and retention; and illicit substance use for those engaged in treatment between 9/2016 and 1/2018. Results: Seventy-four patients completed integrated HCV-OUD treatment with DAA, with 87.8% achieving cure. Of the 66 who completed treatment and were subsequently evaluated for sustained viral response 98.5% were cured. Patients who received integrated HCV and OUD treatment in our clinic, stayed in OUD treatment longer, demonstrated higher OUD medication adherence, and used less opioids or cocaine compared to HCV-infected patients (n = 572) being treated only for OUD. Discussion: We have reported on a reproducible intervention that lends itself to outpatient OUD treatment. Analyses demonstrate the potential positive impact HCV treatment has on OUD recovery, including reduction in opioid and cocaine use and increased retention in care Conclusion: Co-locating HCV treatment with existing OUD treatment is feasible, effective, and demonstrates positive outcomes for the treatment of both conditions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.487)  The COVID-19 pandemic has required novel solutions, including heat disinfection of personal protective equipment (PPE) for potential reuse to ensure availability for healthcare and other frontline workers. Understanding the efficacy of such methods on pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 that may be present on PPE in healthcare settings is key to worker safety, as some pathogenic bacteria are more heat resistant than SARS-CoV-2. We assessed the efficacy of dry heat treatment against Clostridioides difficile spores and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) on filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) coupons in two inoculums. Soil load (mimicking respiratory secretions) and deionized water was used for C. difficile, whereas, soil load and PBS and Tween mixture was used for M. tb. Dry heat treatment at 85 °C for 240 min resulted in a reduction equivalent to 6.0-log10 CFU and 7.3-log10 CFU in C. difficile spores inoculated in soil load and deionized water, respectively. Conversely, treatment at 75 °C for 240 min led to 4.6-log10 CFU reductions in both soil load and deionized water. C. difficile inactivation was higher by >1.5-log10 CFU in deionized water as compared to soil load (p < 0.0001), indicating the latter has a protective effect on bacterial spore inactivation at 85 °C. For M. tb, heat treatment at 75 °C for 90 min and 85 °C for 30 min led to 8-log10 reduction with or without soil load. Heat treatment near the estimated maximal operating temperatures of FFR materials (which would readily eliminate SARS-CoV-2) did not achieve complete inactivation of C. difficile spores but was successful against M. tb. The clinical relevance of surviving C. difficile spores when subjected to heat treatment remains unclear. Given this, any disinfection method of PPE for potential reuse must ensure the discarding of any PPE, potentially contaminated with C. difficile spores, to ensure the safety of healthcare workers.\t\t\n",
      "(0.468)  In intensive care, disputes sometimes arise when patients or surrogates strongly desire treatment, yet health professionals regard it as potentially inappropriate. While professional guidelines confirm that physicians are not always obliged to provide requested treatment, determining when treatment would be inappropriate is extremely challenging. One potential reason for refusing to provide a desired and potentially beneficial treatment is because (within the setting of limited resources) this would harm other patients. Elsewhere in public health systems, cost effectiveness analysis is sometimes used to decide between different priorities for funding. In this paper, we explore whether cost-effectiveness could be used to determine the appropriateness of providing intensive care. We explore a set of treatment thresholds: the probability threshold (a minimum probability of survival for providing treatment), the cost threshold (a maximum cost of treatment), the duration threshold (the maximum duration of intensive care), and the quality threshold (a minimum quality of life). One common objection to cost-effectiveness analysis is that it might lead to rationing of life-saving treatment. The analysis in this paper might be used to inform debate about the implications of applying cost-effectiveness thresholds to clinical decisions around potentially inappropriate treatment.\t\t\n",
      "(0.462)  For over a decade, the vast majority of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have been among young people who inject drugs (PWID). Well-characterized gaps in chronic HCV diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment have resulted in fewer than 5% of PWID receiving HCV treatment. While interferon-based treatment may have intentionally been foregone during part of this time in anticipation of improved oral therapies, the overall pattern points to deficiencies and treatment exclusions in the health care system. Treatment for HCV with all-oral, highly effective direct-acting antiviral medication for 12 weeks or less is now the standard of care, putting renewed focus on effective delivery of care. We describe here both the need for and process of chronic HCV care under the roof of addiction medicine.\t\t\n",
      "(0.462)  The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis is multifactorial and ammonia is thought to play a key role. Astroglial dysfunction is known to be present in HE. Astrocytes are extensively connected by gap junctions formed of connexins, which also exist as functional hemichannels allowing exchange of molecules between the cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu. The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis suggests that neuronal activity is fueled (at least in part) by lactate provided by neighboring astrocytes. We hypothesized that in HE, astroglial dysfunction could impair metabolic communication between astrocytes and neurons. In this study, we determined whether hyperammonemia leads to hemichannel dysfunction and impairs lactate transport in the cerebral cortex using rat models of HE (bile duct ligation [BDL] and induced hyperammonemia) and also evaluated the effect of ammonia-lowering treatment (ornithine phenylacetate [OP]). Plasma ammonia concentration in BDL rats was significantly reduced by OP treatment. Biosensor recordings demonstrated that HE is associated with a significant reduction in both tonic and hypoxia-induced lactate release in the cerebral cortex, which was normalized by OP treatment. Cortical dye loading experiments revealed hemichannel dysfunction in HE with improvement following OP treatment, while the expression of key connexins was unaffected. Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate that HE is associated with central nervous system hemichannel dysfunction, with ammonia playing a key role. The data provide evidence of a potential neuronal energy deficit due to impaired hemichannel-mediated lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons as a possible mechanism underlying pathogenesis of HE.

      "(0.863)  Movie alcohol exposure is a known and consistent predictor of adolescent alcohol use initiation and escalation. Nearly 90% of the top U.S. movies contain alcohol content. Social- cognitive theory posits reciprocal links among environmental influences (e.g., movie alcohol exposure), social- cognitive processes (e.g., perceived norms, susceptibility, alcohol outcome expectancies), and behavior (alcohol use), but these links have been tested in only 1 direction. In the current study, we assessed movie alcohol exposure, alcohol cognitions, and alcohol initiation among adolescents (N = 1,023; 52% female, mean age = 13.7 years) in 4 annual survey waves. Cross-lagged panel models tested bidirectional relations between cognitions and movie alcohol exposure. Finally, we tested bidirectional mediation effects in the prospective prediction of alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure prospectively predicted increases in descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and susceptibility but not positive or negative alcohol outcome expectancies. All factors predicted subsequent alcohol initiation. Close friend injunctive and descriptive norms, peer descriptive norms, and susceptibility mediated the effect of earlier movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure mediated the effect of earlier close friend descriptive norms on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure and social-cognitive processes are interrelated facets that impact alcohol initiation. Permissive cognitions infrequently predicted higher subsequent exposure to movie alcohol. Clinical and preventative implications of this work are discussed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.773)  Objectives. To examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol availability before and after deregulation in 2015 of the alcohol market in Ontario, Canada. Methods. We quantified alcohol access by number of alcohol outlets and hours of retail for all 19 964 neighborhoods in Ontario. We used mixed effects regression models to examine the associations between alcohol access and a validated SES index between 2013 and 2017. Results. Following deregulation, the number of alcohol outlets in Ontario increased by 15.0%. Low neighborhood SES was positively associated with increased alcohol access: lower-SES neighborhoods had more alcohol outlets within 1000 meters and were closer to the nearest alcohol outlets. Outlets located in low-SES neighborhoods kept longer hours of operation. Conclusions. We observed a substantial increase in alcohol access in Ontario following deregulation. Access to alcohol was greatest in low-SES neighborhoods and may contribute to established inequities in alcohol harms. Public Health Implications. Placing limits on number of alcohol outlets and the hours of operation in low-SES neighborhoods offers an opportunity to reduce alcohol-related health inequities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.767)  Preclinical studies support an important role of dopamine D3 receptors (DRD3s) in alcohol use disorder (AUD). In animals, voluntary alcohol consumption increases DRD3 expression, and pharmacological blockade of DRD3s attenuates alcohol self-administration and reinstatement of alcohol seeking. However, these findings have yet to be translated in humans. This study used positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]-(+)-PHNO to compare receptor levels in several dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and DRD3 regions of interest between AUD subjects in early abstinence (n = 17; 6.59 ± 4.14 days of abstinence) and healthy controls (n = 18). We recruited non-treatment seeking subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for AUD. We examined the relationship between DRD2/3 levels and both alcohol craving and alcohol motivation/wanting, using a cue reactivity procedure and an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IVASA) paradigm, respectively. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels in AUD subjects were significantly lower than binding in HCs when looking at all DRD2/3 ROIs jointly (Wilks <U+039B> =.58, F(6,28) =3.33, p = 0.013, <U+03B7>2p = 0.42), however there were no region-specific differences. Binding values demonstrate -12.3% and -16.1% lower [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SMST and SN respectively, though these differences did not withstand Bonferroni corrections. There was a positive association between [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SN (almost exclusively reflective of DRD3) and alpha (lower values reflect higher alcohol demand) in the APT after Bonferroni corrections (r = 0.66, p = 0.0080). This demonstrates that AUD subjects with lower DRD3 levels in the SN exhibit increased demand for alcohol. These results replicate previous findings demonstrating reduced DRD2/3 levels while also supporting a lack of DRD3 upregulation and potential downregulation in early abstinent AUD. Furthermore, the finding that binding in the SN is associated with alcohol demand warrants further examination.\t\t\n",
      "(0.756)  Objectives: In 2015, Ontario partially deregulated alcohol sales by allowing grocery stores to sell alcohol. The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) whether neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) impacted the likelihood that a grocery store began selling alcohol, and (2) whether increases in alcohol retail availability following deregulation differed between neighbourhoods based on SES. Methods: This was a repeated cross-sectional analysis of 1062 grocery stores in 17,096 neighbourhoods in urban Ontario. The association between neighbourhood-level SES and whether a grocery store began selling alcohol was modeled using mixed effect logistic regression. The annual change in drive-distance from a neighbourhood to the closest off-premise alcohol outlet between 2015 and 2020 was modeled using mixed effect linear regression. An interaction between time and SES was included to evaluate whether this change differed between neighbourhoods based on SES. Results: Grocery stores in neighbourhoods in the lowest SES quintile were 39% less likely to start selling alcohol than grocery stores in neighbourhoods in the highest SES quintile (odds ratio (OR): 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.390.94). As grocery store sales expanded, the distance to the closest off-premise alcohol outlet decreased by 51.8 m annually (95% CI: 48.854.9, p < 0.01). A significant interaction between year and SES was observed whereby this trend was more pronounced in high- versus low-SES neighbourhoods. Conclusion: The expansion of grocery store alcohol sales increased alcohol availability, but this increase was proportionately larger in high- versus low-SES neighbourhoods. This reduced historic disparities in alcohol availability between low- and high-SES neighbourhoods.\t\t\n",
      "(0.739)  Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption impairs neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. However, it is unknown whether alcohol produces a similar impairment of neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region that plays an important role in cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) was used for the induction and measurement of associative LTP-like neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Fifteen healthy subjects were administered PAS to the DLPFC following consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water) or placebo beverage in a within-subject cross-over design. PAS induced neuroplasticity was indexed up to 60 minutes following PAS. Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS. Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t =-2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally. Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS. Findings from the present study provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for impairment of cognitive functioning by alcohol. \n",

      "(0.466)  Background: External randomised pilot trials help researchers decide whether, and how, to do a future definitive randomised trial. The progression criteria are often prespecified to inform the interpretation of pilot trial findings and subsequent progression decision-making. We aimed to explore and understand the perspectives and experiences of key stakeholders when making progression decisions following external pilot trials. Methods: Thirty-five remote semi-structured interviews with external randomised pilot trial team members including chief investigators, trial managers, statisticians and patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives. Questions focussed on experiences and perceptions of pilot trial progression decisions and whether and how progression criteria informed this decision. Data were analysed using the framework method approach to thematic analysis. Strategies to ensure trustworthiness and rigour were used. Results: Interviews were conducted between December 2020 and July 2021. Six descriptive themes were developed to capture the experiences and perspectives of participants. These were (1) divided opinions on the value and development of progression criteria, (2) (avoiding) the potential for personal interest to influence progression criteria and progression decision-making, (3) stakeholder engagement in setting progression criteria and making progression decisions, (4) lessons learned from doing the pilot trial and their impact on progression criteria applicability, (5) other factors that inform the progression decision and (6) progression of external randomised pilot trialsfunding considerations and constraints. These themes were underpinned by an overarching interpretative theme a one-size approach to progression does not fit all to describe the highly nuanced and complex decision-making process that occurs following external randomised pilot trials. The progression criteria are rarely the only consideration informing the decision to progress to future research; unanticipated events, signals of efficacy and continuity of the research team are other factors that researchers consider. Conclusions: One size does not fit all when it comes to the progression criteria and pilot trial progression. The progression criteria are only one of many considerations researchers have when deciding whether a pilot trial is feasible. External pilot trial progression is not guaranteed even when a pilot trial is considered feasible (based on the progression criteria and/or other considerations), indicating inefficiency and potential research waste.

While building OpenTrials, an open database of public trial information, we identified errors and omissions in registries, including discrepancies between descriptions of the same trial in different registries. We set out to ascertain the prevalence of discrepancies in trial completion status using a cohort of trials registered on both the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study design and setting We used matching titles and registry IDs provided by both registries to build a cohort of dualregistered trials. Completion statuses were compared; we calculated descriptive statistics on the prevalence of discrepancies. Results 11, 988 dual-registered trials were identified. 1, 496 did not provide a comparable completion status, leaving 10, 492 trials. 16.2% were discrepant on completion status. The majority of discrepancies (90.5%) were a 'completed' trial on ClinicalTrials.gov inaccurately marked as 'ongoing' on EUCTR. Overall, 33.9% of dual-registered trials described as 'ongoing' on EUCTR were listed as 'completed' on ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusion Completion status on registries is commonly inaccurate. Previous work on publication bias may underestimate non-reporting. We describe simple steps registry owners and trialists could take to improve accuracy.\t\t\n",
      "(0.429)  Background: Opportunistic recruitment in primary care is challenging due to the inherent unpredictability of incident conditions, and workload and time pressures. Many clinical trials do not recruit to target, leading to equivocal answers to research questions. Learning from the experiences of patients and recruiters to trials of incident conditions has the potential to improve recruitment and retention to future trials, thereby enhancing the quality and impact of research findings. The aim of this research was to learn from the trial experiences of UTI patients and recruiters to the Cranberry for UTI (CUTI) trial, to help plan an adequately powered trial of similar design. Methods: One-to-one semi-structured interviews were embedded within the CUTI feasibility trial, an open-label, randomised feasibility trial of cranberry extract for symptoms of acute, uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in primary care. Interviews were conducted with a sample of: CUTI trial participants; non-CUTI trial UTI patients; and, recruiters to the CUTI trial. Verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: Twenty-six patients with UTI and eight recruiters (nurses and GPs) to the CUTI trial were interviewed. Three themes were developed around: reasons for participating in research; barriers to opportunistic recruitment; and, UTI patients experiences of trial procedures. Recruiters found that targeted electronic prompts directed at healthcare practitioners based in clinics where patients with incident conditions were likely to present (e.g. minor illness clinic) were more effective than generic prompts (e.g. desk prompts) at filtering patients from their usual clinical pathway to research clinics. Using a script to explain the delayed antibiotic trial group to patients was found to be helpful, and may have served to boost recruitment. For UTI patients, using an electronic diary to rate their symptoms was considered an acceptable medium, and often preferable to using a paper diary or mobile phone application. Conclusions: The use of targeted prompts directed at clinicians, a script to explain trial groups that may be deemed less desirable, and an appropriate diary format for patient-reported outcomes, may help to improve trial recruitment and retention.\t\t\n",
      "(0.419)  Background: The generalizability of findings of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) is undermined by low or biased recruitment. Reasons for participant refusal are infrequently reported in published literature. Aims: To apply the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) to: (1) explore patient-reported reasons for declining to participate in a RCT comparing a new service model (patient-initiated appointments) with standard care (appointments scheduled by clinician) for managing blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm; (2) to explore associations between decliners perceptions of acceptability and non-participation. Method: Eligible patients (n = 242) were approached to participate in the trial. Phase 1: decliners provided a brief reason for refusal. Reasons were analysed descriptively and reviewed against TFA constructs. Phase 2: Consecutive decliners participated in short semi-structured interviews, to explore their reasons for refusal in more depth. Interviews were transcribed and analysed, with the TFA as a coding framework. Results: Eighty-seven (36%) eligible patients refused trial participation; all provided a reason. From interviews with 15 decliners (17%), four key beliefs about acceptability were identified: happy with standard care (n = 41) (49%), anticipated burden of patient-initiated service, lack of confidence in ability to engage with new service and uncertainties about effectiveness of new service. Two themes reflected non-TFA factors: trial participation a low priority and burden of completing trial documentation. Conclusion: Reasons for refusal trial participation included: (a) reasons directly associated with intervention acceptability, and (b) reasons associated with trial participation more broadly. The TFA facilitated identification of problematic aspects of the new appointment booking system which could be addressed to enhance acceptability.\t\t\n",

This article attempts to shed some light on this issue by studying the question design during the direct examination in an American criminal court case using Conversation Analysis. It shows that attorneys use different question forms compared to casual conversation: declaratives are far less prevalent and questions are often designed as requests for action. In addition, attorneys make use of forms that are not found in other types of interaction, such as the tag (is that) correct. The way in which attorneys design their questions additionally shows that the rules of the courtroom have procedural consequences for how the interaction is done. But these rules have to be enacted, and it is in their violation that participants bring about categories such as leading questions.\t\t\n",

However, to facilitate this, we must tailor components of the HIVST kit and process to ensure that we reach and encourage youth to test. The purpose of this study to elucidate concerns and issues regarding HIVST rollout among South African youth. Methods: This study was conducted in two phases: 1) focus group discussions with rural, South African youth aged 18-24 and 2) direct observations of participants completing with an oral HIVST kit and/or a blood based HIVST kit. In phase 2a participants were invited to try both an oral and blood-based HIVST kit. In phase 2b, participants selected the HIVST kit of their choice. Results: We enrolled 35 unique participants in phase 1, 20 participants in phase 2a, and 40 participants in phase 2b. While the focus group discussions highlighted hypothetical HIVST use only, participants appreciated the privacy that the HIVST could afford them. However, they expressed concerns about whether HIVST could be trusted due to false positives and negatives, as well as whether a person would be able to emotionally handle the results if they tested alone. They suggested that the kits be used alongside someone who could provide support. In phases 2a and 2b, participants were overwhelmingly positive about both kits regarding ease of use and whether their results could be trusted. The participants, however, experienced more challenges with the blood-based versus oral test. When given the choice in phase 2b, most participants (80%) chose the oral HIVST over the blood-based HIVST. Conclusions: During the focus group discussions, participants raised concerns about the validity of HIVST, lack of emotional support when testing alone, and the cost of HIVST kits, all of which could be addressed through current testing campaigns. Most of those who actually tested had positive experiences with HIVST and would recommend it to their friends. When offered a choice, most preferred the oral test.

We conducted a study of the drug use and harm reduction experiences of people who inject drugs through research interviews using the LSB to determine whether it has the potential to enhance qualitative research. Our team included community researchers who were current or former drug users and academic researchers. Interviews were conducted by two community researchers: an interviewer and a storyboarder who populated the LSB. Results showed that interviewers and participants interacted with the LSB in different ways. The board functioned to situate the interviewers in the interview schedule, whereas participants often used the board as a way to validate or reinforce their life story. Participants expressed a variety of emotional and cognitive responses to the board. Overall, the LSB helped participants focus on their life story to recall specific occasions or incidents and enabled them to gain perspective and make greater sense of their lives. Both participants and interviewers engaged with the LSB in nuanced ways that enabled them to work together to represent the participant's life story.\t\t\n",
      "(0.374)  Purpose: This study examined the concordance between individuals self-reported rural-urban category of their community and ZIP Code-derived Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) category. Methods: An Internet-based survey, administered from August 2017 through November 2017, was used to collect participants sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported ZIP Code of residence, and perception of which RUCA category best describes the community in which they live. We calculated weighted kappa (<U+0138>) coefficients (95% confidence interval [CI]) to test for concordance between participants ZIP Code-derived RUCA category and their selection of RUCA descriptor. Descriptive frequency distributions of participants' demographics are presented. Findings: A total of 622 survey participants, residents of New Hampshire (63%) and Vermont (37%), responded to the survey's self-reported rural-urban category. The overall <U+0138> was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.27-0.38). The highest concordance was found among those living in a small rural area (N = 81, 13%): 62% of this group identified their communities as small rural. Sixty-five percent (300/459) of participants residing in urban or large rural areas reported their community as more rural (small rural or isolated). Sixty-eight percent (111/163) of participants living in small rural or isolated areas identified their community as more urban (large rural or urban). Conclusions: Discordance was found between self-report of rural-urban category and ZIP Code-derived RUCA designation. Caution is warranted when attributing rural-urban designation to individuals based on geographic unit, since perceived rurality/urbanicity of their community that relates to health behaviors may not be reflected.\t\t\n",
      "(0.369)  We pilot tested a carepartner-assisted intervention to improve oral hygiene in persons with cognitive impairment (participants) and help carepartners become leaders who can adapt approaches that foster participants ability to develop new skills for oral hygiene care. Following the intervention, we conducted interviews with participants and carepartners to understand their challenges in working together to learn new oral hygiene skills. Participants reported challenges such as frustration using the electric toothbrush correctly, lack of desire to change, uncertainty about correctness of technique, and difficulty sustaining two minutes of toothbrushing. Carepartners reported challenges such as learning a new way of toothbrushing, learning new communication techniques, switching from instructing to working together, learning to balance leading with being too bossy, and being mindful of word choices. Findings suggested that despite challenges, participants were able to learn adaptive strategies to support new oral hygiene behaviors with support of the carepartner as the adaptive leader. \n",

      "(0.679)  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is increasing worldwide. A high proportion of individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but RCC has a high mortality rate. These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.\t\t\n",
      "(0.649)  Objectives: Screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) remain suboptimal. The impact of provider strategies to enhance screening participation in the population is uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of provider strategies to increase screening in a single-payer system.Methods:A population-based survey was conducted in primary care providers (PCPs) linked to patients using administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Patients were due for CRC screening from April 2012 to March 2013. Patients were followed up until 31 March 2014. We determined time to become up-to-date with CRC screening. Cox proportional hazards models examined the association between PCP strategies and uptake of screening, adjusted for physician and patient factors.Results:A total of 717 PCPs and their 147,834 rostered patients due for CRC screening were included. Most physicians employed strategies to enhance screening participation, including electronic medical record use, reminders, generation of lists, audit and feedback reports, or designating staff responsible for screening. No single strategy was strongly associated with screening. For those >1 year overdue, a systematic approach to generate lists of patients overdue for screening was weakly associated with screening uptake (hazard ratio (HR)=1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26, P=0.04 >5 years overdue vs. <1 year overdue). The use of multiple PCP strategies was associated with screening participation (HR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.16-1.39, P<0.0001 for PCPs using 4-5 vs. 0-1 strategies). Practice-based strategies were self-reported.Conclusions: In practice, while individual PCP strategies have little effect, the use of multiple strategies to enhance screening appears to improve CRC screening uptake in patients.\t\t\n",
      "(0.648)  Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underutilized by Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured. Multiple national and state policies were enacted from 2010 to 2014 to increase access to Medicaid and to promote CRC screening among Medicaid enrollees. We aimed to determine the impact of these policies on screening initiation among newly enrolled Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries age-eligible for CRC screening. Methods: We identified national and state policies affecting Medicaid coverage and preventive services in Oregon during 2010-2014. We used Oregon Medicaid claims data from 2010 to 2015 to conduct a cohort analysis of enrollees who turned 50 and became age-eligible for CRC screening (a prevention milestone, and an age at which guideline-concordant screening can be assessed within a single year) during each year from 2010 to 2014. We calculated risk ratios to assess whether first year of Medicaid enrollment and/or year turned 50 was associated with CRC screening initiation. Results: We identified 14,576 Oregon Medicaid enrollees who turned 50 during 2010-2014; 2429 (17%) completed CRC screening within 12 months after turning 50. Individuals newly enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 or 2014 were 1.58 and 1.31 times more likely, respectively, to initiate CRC screening than those enrolled by 2010. A primary care visit in the calendar year, having one or more chronic conditions, and being Hispanic was also associated with CRC screening initiation. Discussion: The increased uptake of CRC screening in 2013 and 2014 is associated with the timing of policies such as Medicaid expansion, enhanced federal matching for preventive services offered to Medicaid enrollees without cost sharing, and formation of Medicaid accountable care organizations, which included CRC screening as an incentivized quality metric.\t\t\n",
      "(0.626)  Background: Kidney cancer is often asymptomatic, leading to proposals for a screening programme. The views of the public towards introducing a new screening programme for kidney cancer are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore attitudes towards kidney cancer screening and factors influencing intention to attend a future screening programme. Methods: We conducted an online population-based survey of 1021 adults aged 4577 years. The main outcome measure was intention to attend four possible screening tests (urine, blood, ultrasound scan, low-dose CT) as well as extended low-dose CT scans within lung cancer screening programmes. We used multivariable regression to examine the association between intention and each screening test. Results: Most participants stated that they would be very likely or likely to undergo each of the screening tests [urine test: n = 961 (94.1%); blood test: n = 922 (90.3%); ultrasound: n = 914 (89.5%); low-dose CT: n = 804 (78.8%); lung CT: n = 962 (95.2%)]. Greater intention to attend was associated with higher general cancer worry and less perceived burden/inconvenience about the screening tests. Less worry about the screening test was also associated with higher intention to attend, but only in those with low general cancer worry (cancer worry scale = 5). Compared with intention to take up screening with a urine test, participants were half as likely to report that they intended to undergo blood [OR 0.56 (0.430.73)] or ultrasound [OR 0.50 (0.380.67)] testing, and half as likely again to report that they intended to take part in a screening programme featuring a low dose CT scan for kidney cancer screening alone [OR 0.19 (0.140.27)]. Conclusion: Participants in this study expressed high levels of intention to accept an invitation to screening for kidney cancer, both within a kidney cancer specific screening programme and in conjunction with lung cancer screening. The choice of screening test is likely to influence uptake. Together these findings support on-going research into kidney cancer screening tests and the potential for combining kidney cancer screening with existing or new screening programmes.\t\t\n",
      "(0.618)  Background: Decades of persuasive messages have reinforced the importance of traditional screening mammography at regular intervals. A potential new paradigm, risk-based screening, adjusts mammography frequency based on a womans estimated breast cancer risk in order to maximize mortality reduction while minimizing false positives and overdiagnosis. Womens views of risk-based screening are unknown. Objective: To explore womens views and personal acceptability of a potential risk-based mammography screening paradigm. Design: Four semi-structured focus group discussions about screening mammography and surveys before provision of information about risk-based screening. We analyzed coded focus group transcripts using a mixed deductive (content analysis) and inductive (grounded theory) approach. Participants: Convenience sample of 29 women (4074 years old) with no personal history of breast cancer recruited by print and online media in New Hampshire and Vermont. Results: Twenty-seven out of 29 women reported having undergone mammography screening. All participants were white and most were highly educated. Some women accepted the idea that early cancer detection with traditional screening was beneficialalthough many also reported hearing inconsistent recommendations from clinicians and mixed messages from media reports about mammography. Some women were familiar with a risk-based screening paradigm (primarily related to cervical cancer, n = 8) and thought matching screening mammography frequency to personal risk made sense (n = 8). Personal acceptability of risk-based screening was mixed. Some believed risk-based screening could reduce the harms of false positives and overdiagnosis (n = 7). Others thought screening less often might result in missing a dangerous diagnosis (n = 14). Many (n = 18) expressed concerns about the feasibility of risk-based screening and questioned whether breast cancer risk estimates could be accurate. Some suspected that risk-based mammography was motivated by a desire to save money (n = 6). Conclusion: Some women thought risk-based screening made sense. Willingness to abandon traditional screening for the new paradigm was mixed. Broad acceptability of risk-based screening will require clearer communication about its rationale and feasibility and consistent messages from the health care team. \n",

      "(0.648)  Despite recent evidence that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) possesses roles in gene regulation distinct from 5-methylcytosine (5mC), relatively little is known regarding the functions of 5hmC in mammalian tissues. To address this issue, we utilized an approach combining both paired bisulfite (BS) and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) DNA treatment, to resolve genome-wide patterns of 5hmC and 5mC in normal breast tissue from disease-free women. Although less abundant than 5mC, 5hmC was differentially distributed, and consistently enriched among breast-specific enhancers and transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, regulatory regions associated with transcriptional inactivity, such as heterochromatin and repressed Polycomb regions, were relatively depleted of 5hmC. Gene regions containing abundant 5hmC were significantly associated with lactate oxidation, immune cell function, and prolactin signaling pathways. Furthermore, genes containing abundant 5hmC were enriched among those actively transcribed in normal breast tissue. Finally, in independent data sets, normal breast tissue 5hmC was significantly enriched among CpG loci demonstrated to have altered methylation in pre-invasive breast cancer and invasive breast tumors. Primarily, our findings identify genomic loci containing abundant 5hmC in breast tissues and provide a genome-wide map of nucleotide-level 5hmC in normal breast tissue. Additionally, these data suggest 5hmC may participate in gene regulatory programs that are dysregulated during breast-related carcinogenesis.\t\t\n",
      "(0.631)  Background: Consistency in reporting Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density on mammograms is important because breast density is used for breast cancer risk assessment and is reported directly to women and clinicians to inform decisions about supplemental screening. Purpose: To assess the consistency of BI-RADS density reporting between digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and digital mammography (DM) and evaluate density as a breast cancer risk factor when assessed using DM versus DBT. Materials and Methods: The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium is a prospective cohort study of women undergoing mammography with DM or DBT. This secondary analysis included women aged 40-79 years who underwent at least two screening mammography examinations less than 36 months apart. Percentage agreement and k statistic were estimated for pairs of BI-RADS density assessments. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of breast density as a risk factor for invasive breast cancer. Results: A total of 403 326 pairs of mammograms from 342 149 women were evaluated. There were no significant differences in breast density assessment in pairs consisting of one DM and one DBT examination (57 516 of 74 729 [77%]; k = 0.64), two DM examinations (238 678 of 301 743 [79%]; k = 0.67), and two DBT examinations (20 763 of 26 854 [77%]; k = 0.65). Results were similar when restricting the analyses to pairs read by the same radiologist. The breast cancer HRs for breast density were similar for DM and DBT (P = .45 for interaction). The HRs for density acquired using DM and DBT, respectively, were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.63) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.66) for almost entirely fat, 1.47 (95% CI: 1.37, 1.58) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.82) for heterogeneously dense, and 1.72 (95% CI: 1.54, 1.93) and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.25, 3.36) for extremely dense breasts. Conclusion: Radiologist reporting of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System density obtained with digital breast tomosynthesis did not differ from that obtained with digital mammography.\t\t\n",
      "(0.62)  Purpose: Little is known about the three-dimensional shape of breast cancer. Implicit to approaches that localize the center of the tumor for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) of non-palpable cancers is the assumption that breast cancers are spherical about a central point, which may not be accurate. Methods: Pre-operative supine breast MRI images were obtained of 83 breast cancer patients undergoing partial mastectomy using supine MRI-guided resection techniques. Three-dimensional (3D) tumor models were derived after radiologists outlined tumor edges on successive MRI slices. Ideal resection volumes were determined by adding 1 cm in every dimension to the actual tumor volume. Geometrically defined parameters were used to define tumor shapes and associations between clinical variables and shapes were examined. Results: Seventy-five patients had invasive cancer. Breast cancers were categorized into four tumor shapes: 34% of tumors were discoidal, 29% segmental, 19% spherical, and 18% irregular. If hypothetical spherical excisions were performed, non-spherical cases would excise 143% more tissue than the ideal resection volume. When the 3D shape of each tumor was provided to the surgeon during MR-guided BCS, the percentage of tissue overexcised in non-spherical cases was significantly less (143% vs. 66%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Information obtained from a supine MRI can be used to generate 3D tumor models and rapidly classify breast tumor shapes. The vast majority of invasive cancers and DCIS are not spherical. Knowledge of tumor shape may allow surgeons to excise breast cancer more precisely.\t\t\n",
      "(0.565)  While changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumour DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumour. Matched tumour, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select epithelial cells from normal tissue, and neoplastic cells from tumour for genome-scale measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between contralateral-normal and tumour (63,271 CpG loci q < 0.01), than between ipsilateral-normal and tumour (38,346 CpG loci q < 0.01). We identified differential methylation in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p < 0.01). In this comparison, hypomethylated loci were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3 and hypermethylated loci were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions. In addition, progression of shore hypermethylation was observed in tumours compared to matched ipsilateral normal tissue, and these alterations tracked to several well-established tumour suppressor genes. Our results indicate an epigenetic field effect in surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.

      "(0.563)  Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. Through an epigenome-wide association study we explored CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, RefFreeCellMix cell estimates, time of delivery, array chip and subject as random effect. We identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a subsequent breast cancer diagnosis (q-value <0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer. \n",

Attentional processes are particularly affected in older adults with white matter hyperintensities (WMH), although specific neurovascular mechanisms have not been elucidated. We aimed to identify differences in attention-related neurofunctional activation and behavior between adults with and without WMH. Older adults with moderate to severe WMH (n = 18, mean age = 70 years), age-matched adults (n = 28, mean age = 72), and healthy younger adults (n = 19, mean age = 25) performed a modified flanker task during multi-echo blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Task-related activation was assessed using a weighted-echo approach. Healthy older adults had more widespread response and higher amplitude of activation compared to WMH adults in fronto-temporal and parietal cortices. Activation associated with processing speed was absent in the WMH group, suggesting attention-related activation deficits that may be a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease. WMH adults had greater executive contrast activation in the precuneous and posterior cingulate gyrus compared to HYA, despite no performance benefits, reinforcing the network dysfunction theory in WMH.\t\t\n",
      "(0.54)  The literature has documented a positive relationship between walkable built environments and outdoor mobility in older adults. Yet, surprisingly absent is any consideration of how weather conditions modify the impact of neighbourhood walkability. Using archived weather data linked to survey data collected from a sample of older adults in Vancouver, Canada, we found that car-dependent neighbourhoods (featuring longer block lengths, fewer intersections, and greater distance to amenities) became inaccessible in snow. Even older adults who lived in very walkable neighbourhoods walked to 25 per cent fewer destinations in snow. It is crucial to consider the impact of weather in the relationship between neighbourhood walkability and older adult mobility.\t\t\n",
      "(0.505)  Individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can suffer from episodic memory impairments. Until now, the neural correlates underlying episodic retrieval in individuals with TBI remained scarce, particularly in older adults. We aimed to fill this gap by recording event-related potentials during an old/new episodic recognition task in 26 older adults, 13 healthy and 13 with TBI. The task manipulated the level of processing in encoding with the use of semantic organizational strategies (deep guided, deep self-guided, and shallow encoding). For all encoding conditions, behavioral data analyses on the discrimination rate indicated that older adults with TBI were globally impaired compared with healthy older adults. The electrophysiological results indicated that the left-parietal effect was larger in the deep guided condition than in the shallow condition. In addition, the results show that the mid-frontal and left-parietal positive old/new effects were absent in both groups. The main findings are the observation, in the control group only, of an early frontal old/new effect (P200; 150300 ms) and of a late frontal old/new effect on the left hemisphere, only in the Spontaneous condition. Together, results suggest an impairment of the allocation of attentional resources and working memory necessary for retrieving and monitoring items in the elderly with TBI.\t\t\n",

Data from 888 young adults with T1D were reviewed (ages 18-30 years, 52% female, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 8.1% ± 1.5%). Prescription of CGM was recorded for 54% of young adults; 66% were pump users, 46% on insulin injections and carbohydrate (carb) counting, and 32% on insulin doses without carb counting (P = 0.001). HbA1c was lower in young adults with CGM versus no CGM (7.7% ± 1.3% vs. 8.2% ± 1.7%, P = 0.001). Difference in HbA1c between CGM versus no CGM was greater in young adults noncarb counting (7.9% ± 1.4% vs. 8.9% ± 2.3%, P = 0.002) than carb counting (7.7% ± 1.5% vs. 8.2% ± 1.7%, P = 0.0008), or pump users (7.6 ± 1.2 vs. 7.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.01).

      "(0.43)  Background: Creating neighbourhood places for older adults to be socially and physically active is a global health priority. Safety is integral to older adult mobility. In greenway research, perceived safety is often only partially or superficially explored. Our study comprehensively examines older adults experiences and perceived safety for walking on a new urban greenway in Vancouver, Canadathe Arbutus Greenway. Methods: We integrated mixed methods: i) observational count data to describe the use and context of the greenway over 3 years (2017; 2018; 2019), and; ii) semi-structured interviews with older adults at two time points (2017, n = 27; 2019, n = 16). Results: and discussion: We conducted thematic analysis to illuminate older adults' experiences across three safety domains: personal safety, traffic safety, and security. Built environment features such as benches, paving, road markings, and natural foliage buffers intersected with elements of the social environment to influence older adults perceived safety. While the greenway supported active transportation, leisure, and social engagement for many older adults, certain factors also provoked fears, especially for older adults with mobility limitations. We advocate for a multidimensional lens to better understand how urban interventions influence perceived safety, and identify practical solutions to encourage mobility for all ages and abilities. \n",

A national survey, in 2017, aimed to describe and compare the features of HAH services and understand key enablers to service provision. Methods Service managers of adult HAH services in the  Hospice UK' and National Association for Hospice at Home directories within England were invited to participate. Information on service configuration, referral, staffing, finance, care provision and enablers to service provision were collected by telephone interview. Results Of 128 services invited, 70 (54.7%) provided data. Great diversity was found. Most services operated in mixed urban/rural (74.3%) and mixed deprivation (77.1%) areas and provided hands-on care (97.1%), symptom assessment and management (91.4%), psychosocial support (94.3%) and respite care (74.3%). Rapid response (within 4 hours) was available in 65.7%; hands-on care 24 hours a day in 52.2%. Charity donations were the main source of funding for 71.2%. Key enablers for service provision included working with local services (eg, district nursing, general practitioner services), integrated health records, funding and anticipatory care planning. Access to timely medication and equipment was critical. Conclusion There is considerable variation in HAH services in England. Due to this variation it was not possible to categorise services into delivery types. Services work to supplement local care using a flexible approach benefitting from integration and funding. Further work defining service features related to patient and/or carer outcomes would support future service development.\t\t\n",

The Champlain BASETM (Building Access to Specialists through eConsultation) service facilitates asynchronous communication between primary care providers (PCP) and specialists. The service was extended to several PCPs in Nunavut in 2014. Objective: To (1) describe the use of eConsult services in Nunavut, and (2) conduct a costing evaluation. Design: A cross-sectional study and cost analysis of all eConsult cases submitted between August 2014 and April 2016. Results: PCPs from Nunavut submitted 165 eConsult cases. The most popular specialties were dermatology (16%), cardiology (8%), endocrinology (7%), otolaryngology (7%), and obstetrics/gynaecology (7%). Specialists provided a response in a median of 0.9 days (IQR=0.33.0, range=0.0115.02). In 35% of cases, PCPs were able to avoid the face-to-face specialist visits they had originally planned for their patients. Total savings associated with eConsult in Nunavut are estimated at $180,552.73 or $1,100.93 per eConsult. Conclusions: The eConsult service provided patients in Nunavuts remote communities with prompt access to specialist advice. The services chief advantage in Canadas northern communities is its ability to offer electronic access to a breadth of specialties far greater than could be supported locally. Our findings suggest that a territory-wide adoption of eConsult would generate enormous savings.\t\t\n",
      "(0.418)  Ensuring access to healthcare in emergency health situations is a persistent concern for health system planners. Emergency services, including critical care units for severe burns and coronary events, are amongst those for which travel time is the most crucial, potentially making a difference between life and death. Although it is generally assumed that access to healthcare is not an issue in densely populated urban areas due to short distances, we prove otherwise by applying improved methods of assessing accessibility to emergency services by the urban poor that take traffic variability into account. Combining unique data on emergency health service locations, traffic flow variability and informal settlements boundaries, we generated time-cost based service areas to assess the extent to which emergency health services are reachable by urban slum dwellers when realistic traffic conditions and their variability in time are considered. Variability in traffic congestion is found to have significant impact on the measurement of timely access to, and availability of, healthcare services for slum populations. While under moderate traffic conditions all slums in Dhaka City are within 60-minutes travel time from an emergency service, in congested traffic conditions only 63% of the citys slum population is within 60-minutes reach of most emergency services, and only 32% are within 60-minutes reach of a Burn Unit. Moreover, under congested traffic conditions only 12% of slums in Dhaka City Corporation comply with Bangladeshs policy guidelines that call for access to 1 health service per 50,000 population for most emergency service types, and not a single slum achieved this target for Burn Units. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) and First Aid & Casualty services provide the best coverage, with nearly 100% of the slum population having timely access within 60-minutes in any traffic condition. Ignoring variability in traffic conditions results in a 3-fold overestimation of geographic coverage and masks intra-urban inequities in accessibility to emergency care, by overestimating geographic accessibility in peripheral areas and underestimating the same for central city areas. The evidence provided can help policy makers and urban planners improve health service delivery for the urban poor. We recommend that taking traffic conditions be taken into account in future GIS-based analysis and planning for healthcare service accessibility in urban areas.\t\t\n",
      "(0.406)  Background and objective Strong integration between primary and secondary healthcare is essential. Health services across Australia have developed General Practice Liaison (GPL) services to improve communication and understanding between general practitioners (GPs) and hospitals. The aim of this study was to explore GPs' experiences of and interaction with a health service's GPL service and capture perspectives concerning future service expansion. Methods This descriptive qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with 10 GPs in the catchment area of a large urban health service in Melbourne in 2018. Data were analysed thematically. Results While GPs accepted the value of a GPL service, few had direct experience. Acknowledging the challenge of negotiating complex healthcare systems, they saw GPL services ideally staffed by a health professional, not necessarily a GP. Discussion The results provide insight into what GPs want from a GPL service. This can inform development of the GPL role within health services.\t\t\n",
      "(0.402)  Background: Equitable access to primary health care (PHC) is an important component of integrated chronic disease management. Whilst context is known to influence access to PHC, it is poorly researched. The aim of this study was to determine the contextual influences associated with access arrangements in four Australian models of integrated PHC. Methods: A multi-method comparative case study design. Purposive sampling identified four models of PHC across six sites in two Australian states. Complexity theory informed the choice of contextual factors that influenced access arrangements, which were analysed across five dimensions: availability and accommodation, affordability, acceptability, appropriateness and approachability. Semi-structured interviews, document/website analysis and non-participant observation were used to collect data from clinicians, administrative staff and other key stakeholders. Within and cross-case thematic analysis identified interactions between context and access across sites. Results: Overall, financial viability, objectives of the PHC model and relationships with the local hospital network (LHN) underpinned access arrangements. Local supply of general practitioners and financial viability were strong influences on availability of after-hours services. Influences on affordability were difficult to determine because all models had nil/low out-of-pocket costs for general practitioner services. The biggest influence on acceptability was the goal/objectives of the PHC model. Appropriateness and to a lesser degree affordability arrangements were influenced by the relationship with the LHN. The provision of regular outreach services was strongly influenced by perceived population need, referral networks and model objectives. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for policy makers charged with improving access arrangements in PHC services. A financially sustainable service underpins attempts to improve access that meets the needs of the service population. Smaller services may lack infrastructure and capacity, suggesting there may be a minimum size for enhancing access. Access arrangements may be facilitated by aligning the objectives between PHC, LHN and other stakeholder models. While some access arrangements are relatively easy to modify, improving resource intensive (e.g. acceptability) access arrangements for vulnerable and/or chronic disease populations will require federal and state policy levers with input from primary health networks and LHNs. \n",

      "(0.876)  Rationale and objectives: Medical humanities are becoming increasingly recognized as positively impacting medical education and medical practice. However, the extent of medical humanities teaching in medical schools is largely unknown. We reviewed medical school curricula in Canada, the UK and the US. We also explored the relationship between medical school ranking and the inclusion of medical humanities in the curricula. Methods: We searched the curriculum websites of all accredited medical schools in Canada, the UK and the US to check which medical humanities topics were taught, and whether they were mandatory or optional. We then noted rankings both by Times Higher Education and U.S. News and World Report and calculated the average rank. We formally explored whether there was an association between average medical school ranking and medical humanities offerings using Spearman's correlation and inverse variance weighting meta-analysis. Results: We identified 18 accredited medical school programmes in Canada, 41 in the UK, and 154 in the US. Of these, nine (56%) in Canada, 34 (73%) in the UK and 124 (80%) in the US offered at least one medical humanity that was not ethics. The most common medical humanities were medical humanities (unspecified), history, and literature (Canada); sociology and social medicine, medical humanities (unspecified), and art (UK); and medical humanities (unspecified), literature and history (US). Higher ranked medical schools appeared less likely to offer medical humanities. Conclusions: The extent and content of medical humanities offerings at accredited medical schools in Canada, the UK and the US varies, and there appears to be an inverse relationship between medical school quality and medical humanities offerings. Our analysis was limited by the data provided on the Universities' websites. Given the potential for medical humanities to improve medical education and medical practice, opportunities to reduce this variation should be exploited.\t\t\n",
      "(0.856)  Medical educators and leaders have called for greater diversity among the physician workforce, including those with disabilities. However, many students with disabilities are precluded from entering and completing medical training due to historically restrictive technical standards and poor internal practices to protect student privacy. This limits the possibilities for growing this part of the workforce and making progress toward the ultimate goal of having a physician workforce that better represents the patients it serves. To achieve diversity among the physician workforce, medical education must create environments that allow students with disabilities to apply to, flourish in, and feel well supported in medical school. Recent additions to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements have helped to catalyze work in the area of disability inclusion by incorporating disability-focused mandates into graduate medical education accreditation standards. However, similar mandates for undergraduate medical education have not yet materialized. In this article, the authors call for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to elevate disability as a valued part of medical school diversity in its accreditation standards and to include protections for disabled students. The authors propose that the LCME can take 5 actions to promote institutional accountability toward students with disabilities: (1) define disability as diversity, (2) mandate disability support, (3) protect from conflicts of interest, (4) protect privacy, and (5) verify schools' technical standards comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. By adopting these recommendations, the LCME would send the powerful message that students with disabilities bring welcome expertise and value to the medical community.\t\t\n",
      "(0.767)  Objective To explore medical students' views on and experiences of responding to out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Setting University College London (UCL). Participants 11 UCL Medical School students. Study design Qualitative. Methods and outcome measures We carried out 11 one-To-one semistructured interviews, with participant validation and reflective work. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Three core themes were identified. (1) 'We Did Debate a Bit: Should We Go? Should We Not?'-Students' decisions to respond were based on the appearance of the casualty; the presence and actions of bystanders; witnessing the incident; self-perceived competence, confidence and knowledge; and personal experiences and feelings associated with medical emergencies. (2) 'It Would Represent the Medical Profession Well if We Did Step In and Help'-Students felt that they had an ethical and/or professional duty to help. (3) 'No One Should Die Because of a Lack of.. Basic Life-Saving Techniques'-Students felt that medical school training alone had not sufficiently prepared them to respond to out-of-hospital medical emergencies. Improvements to training were suggested: integrating first aid/response training into the horizontal (systems-based) modules; teaching both common and less common medical emergencies and presentations; training that is led by experienced first responders and that increases students' exposure to out-of-hospital medical emergencies; and providing more revision training sessions. Conclusions Students felt that medical school training could be improved to better prepare them for responding to out-of-hospital medical emergencies, and wanted clarification on whether or not they have an ethical and/or professional duty to help. Further mixed-methods research using a larger sample needs to be carried out to confirm whether findings are transferable to other UK medical schools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.741)  Background: Intellectual curiosity can be defined as a desire for knowledge that leads to exploratory behavior and consists of an inherent and stable trait (i.e. trait curiosity) and a variable context-dependent state (i.e. state curiosity). Although intellectual curiosity has been considered an important aspect of medical education and practice, its relationship to medical education has not been empirically investigated. The purpose of this exploratory study was to describe medical students intellectual curiosity across a four-year undergraduate program. Methods: We employed a cross-sectional design in which medical students, across a four-year undergraduate program at McGill University, completed the Melbourne Curiosity Inventory as a measure of their state and trait intellectual curiosity. A Mixed Models ANOVA was used to compare students across year of training. Results: Four hundred and two out of 751 students completed the inventory (53.5%). Trait curiosity was significantly higher than state curiosity (M = 64.5, SD = 8.5 versus M = 58.5, SD = 11.6) overall, and within each year of training. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe state and trait intellectual curiosity in undergraduate medical education. Findings suggest that medical students state curiosity may not be optimally supported and highlight avenues for further research.\t\t\n",
      "(0.712)  Background: The ability to construct simple computer programs (coding) is being progressively recognized as a life skill. Coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. There is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world. Objective: The aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course? (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school? and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors? Methods: We developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. The course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. We explored in focus groups (FGs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Results: Our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. In addition, 6 major themes emerged from the FGs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students' skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design. Conclusions: Medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. They valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research. They considered that coding skills teaching should be offered as an optional part of the medical curriculum. \n",

      "(0.683)  Background and objectives: HPV vaccination coverage is lower than that of other adolescent vaccines in the southern US. This study sought to characterize caregiver attitudes associated with adolescent HPV vaccination in the southern US and to inform interventions to promote HPV vaccination. Methods: From December 2019  January 2020, caregivers of adolescents (ages 917 years) living in thirteen southern US states were recruited from a nationally-representative online survey panel. Caregivers (N = 1,105) completed a cross-sectional survey that assessed general adolescent vaccine attitudes as well as those associated with the HPV vaccine and HPV vaccination decision-making. The primary study outcome was adolescents receipt of at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. Results: Caregivers with vaccinated adolescents had greater positive attitudes towards adolescent vaccines compared to caregivers of unvaccinated adolescents. Top three areas of concern among caregivers were related to vaccine ingredients, perceptions that adolescents receive too many vaccines, and worry about vaccine side effects. In multivariable regression models, positive attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and HPV vaccination decision-making strongly associated with HPV vaccination in addition to general adolescent vaccination attitudes. Caregivers reported discomfort with discussing the topic of sex was predictive of lower vaccination uptake for older adolescents. Conclusions: Public health messaging in the southern US should be tailored to reduce concerns about vaccine safety and to communicate the importance of timely HPV vaccination. Campaigns that deliver information specific to the HPV vaccine and to support vaccination decision-making may be more effective than those delivering only general adolescent vaccination information at promoting on-time HPV vaccination.\t\t\n",
      "(0.675)  Background: Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion regarding the benefits of receiving the current season's vaccine. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: current season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (dVE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241). Results: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (dVE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (dVE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (dVE = 7%; 95% CI - 7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the current season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (dVE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (dVE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (dVE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the current season only for H1N1 (dVE = 3%; 95% CI - 8%, 13%), but less protection against influenza H3N2 (dVE = - 20%; 95% CI - 36%, - 4%), and B (dVE = - 11%; 95% CI - 20%, - 2%). Conclusions: Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes, and for H1N1 and influenza B, vaccination in both seasons provides better VE than vaccination in the prior season only. Although VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only, it should be noted that past vaccination history cannot be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only. In addition, our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014-2015 influenza season and the impact of repeated vaccination for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season. It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail.\t\t\n",
      "(0.627)  Background: Many countries recommend influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Despite this recommendation, influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains under-utilized and uptake varies by country. Factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy may also vary across countries. Methods: As members of the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), five sites from four countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States) retrospectively identified cohorts of individuals aged 1850 years who were pregnant during pre-defined influenza seasons. Influenza vaccine coverage estimates were calculated for the 201011 through 201516 northern hemisphere and the 2012 through 2015 southern hemisphere influenza seasons, by site. Sites used electronic health records, administrative data, and immunization registries to collect information on pregnancy, health history, demographics, and vaccination status. Each season, vaccination coverage was calculated as the percentage of individuals who received influenza vaccine among the individuals in the cohort that season. Characteristics were compared between those vaccinated and unvaccinated, by site. Results: More than two million pregnancies were identified over the study period. Influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 5% to 58% across sites and seasons. Coverage increased consistently over the study period at three of the five sites (Western Australia, Alberta, and Israel), and was highest in all seasons at the United States study site (3958%). Associations with vaccination varied by country and across seasons; where available, parity >0, presence of a high-risk medical condition, and urban residence were consistently associated with increased likelihood of vaccination. Conclusions: Though increasing, uptake of influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains lower than recommended. Coverage varied substantially by country, suggesting an ongoing need for targeted strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake in this population.\t\t\n",
      "(0.627)  Objective: The purpose of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of male and female college students in Kentucky about HPV associated diseases and vaccines, and to determine which parameters predicted self-reported uptake of HPV vaccination. Materials and methods: A self-selected cross-sectional sample of college students completed an evidence-based online survey. Results: Of approximately 1200 potential respondents, 585 completed the survey. The average age was 20.6 (SD 3.15) and 78% were female; 84% of the population had had one or more sexual partners. Concern for HPV vaccine safety and potential need for boosters did not significantly deter vaccine uptake. Likewise, knowledge about HPV associated cancers was not predictive of vaccine uptake. On the other hand, parental influence for vaccination was a strong predictor for vaccine uptake (aOR = 5.32, 2.7113.03), and free vaccine nearly doubled the likelihood of being vaccinated (aOR 1.90, 1.053.41). In addition, the strong preference for the respondent's partner to be HPV vaccinated predicted vaccine uptake (aOR = 4.04, 95% CI: 2.317.05), but the lack of preference for partner vaccination predicted an unvaccinated self (aOR = 0.50, 0.270.93). Conclusions: HPV vaccination has been successful in young adult college students in Kentucky. Young adults prefer their partners to be HPV vaccinated regardless of whether they themselves are vaccinated. Parental influence and free vaccine were positive predictors for vaccine uptake in this population.\t\t\n",
      "(0.616)  Introduction: In 2015/2016, Canada's largest provinces implemented publicly-funded human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) = 26 years old. We sought to describe HPV vaccine uptake among GBM and determine barriers and facilitators to vaccine initiation with a focus on healthcare access and utilization. Methods: Engage is a cohort study among GBM aged 16 + years in three Canadian cities recruited from 2017 to 2019 via respondent driven sampling (RDS). Men completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline. By publicly-funded vaccine eligibility (=26 years old = eligible for vaccination, =27 years old = ineligible), we described HPV vaccine uptake (initiation = 1 + dose, completion = 3 doses) and explored factors associated with vaccine initiation using Poisson regression. All analyses were weighted with the RDS-II Volz-Heckathorn estimator. Results: Across the three cities, 2635% and 1421% of men = 26 years and 726% and 29% of men = 27 years initiated and completed HPV vaccination, respectively. Vaccine initiation was significantly associated with STI/HIV testing or visiting a HIV care specialist in the past six months (=26: prevalence ratio[PR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.064.36; =27: PR = 2.73, 95%CI 1.146.51) and past hepatitis A or B vaccination (=26: PR = 2.88, 95%CI 1.645.05; =27: PR = 2.03, 95%CI 1.073.86). Among men = 27 years old, vaccine initiation was also positively associated with accessing PrEP, living in Vancouver or Toronto, but negatively associated with identifying as Latin American and increasing age. Vaccine initiation was twice as likely among men = 27 years with private insurance versus no insurance. Conclusions: Sixty-five to 74% of men eligible for publicly-funded vaccine across the three cities remained unvaccinated against HPV by 2019. High vaccine cost may partly explain even lower uptake among men = 27 years old. Men seeking sexual health care were more likely to initiate vaccination; bundling vaccination with these services may help improve HPV vaccine uptake. \n",
