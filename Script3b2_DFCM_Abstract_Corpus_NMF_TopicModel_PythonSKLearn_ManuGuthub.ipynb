       "[['(0.793)  Objective: Treat-to-target (TTT) is an accepted paradigm for care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because TTT can be associated with more medication switches, concerns arise regarding whether implementing TTT may increase adverse events and/or resource use. The aim of this study was to examine adverse events and resource use during the preintervention and intervention periods of the TTT intervention trial. Methods: We used data from 6 practices enrolled in an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare adverse events and resource use before (months 1\\x969) and during (months 10\\x9618) a TTT intervention. The outcomes of interest, adverse events and resource use, were based on medical record review of all rheumatology visits for RA patients before and during the intervention. Results: We examined records for 321 patients before the intervention and 315 during the intervention. An adverse event was recorded in 10.2% of visits before the intervention and 8.8% of visits during the intervention (P = 0.41). Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were taken by 53.6% of patients before the intervention and 49.8% of patients during the intervention (P = 0.73). Rheumatology visits were more frequent before the intervention (mean ± SD 4.0 ± 1.4) than during the intervention (mean ± SD 3.6 ± 1.2; P = 0.02). More visits were accompanied by monitoring laboratory tests before the intervention (90.0%) compared with during the intervention (52.7%; P < 0.001). A greater percentage of visits before the intervention included diagnostic imaging (15.4%) versus during the intervention (8.9%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: We observed similar rates of adverse events before and during the implementation of TTT for RA. Rheumatology visits, use of laboratory monitoring, and diagnostic imaging did not increase during the TTT intervention.',\n",
       "  '(0.748)  Increasing condom use to prevent sexually transmitted infections is a key public health goal. Interventions are more likely to be effective if they are theory- and evidence-based. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) provides a framework for intervention development. To provide an example of how the BCW was used to develop an intervention to increase condom use in heterosexual men (the MenSS website), the steps of the BCW intervention development process were followed, incorporating evidence from the research literature and views of experts and the target population. Capability (e.g. knowledge) and motivation (e.g. beliefs about pleasure) were identified as important targets of the intervention. We devised ways to address each intervention target, including selecting interactive features and behaviour change techniques. The BCW provides a useful framework for integrating sources of evidence to inform intervention content and deciding which influences on behaviour to target.',\n",
       "  '(0.738)  Objectives. We evaluated an environmental intervention intended to increase sales of lower-fat foods in secondary school cafeterias. Methods. Twenty secondary schools were randomly assigned to either an environmental intervention or a control group for a 2-year period. The intervention increased the availability of lower-fat foods and implemented student-based promotions. Results. A steeper rate of increase in sales of lower-fat foods in year 1 (10% intervention vs -2.8% control, P=.002) and a higher percentage of sales of lower-fat foods in year 2 (33.6% intervention vs 22.1% control, P=.04) were observed. There were no significant changes in student self-reported food choices. Conclusions. School-based environmental interventions to increase availability and promotion of lower-fat foods can increase purchase of these foods among adolescents.',\n",
       "  \"(0.729)  Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of recruitment, adherence and likely effectiveness of an e-learning intervention for managers to improve employees' well-being and reduce sickness absence. Methods: The GEM Study (guided e-learning for managers) was a mixed methods pilot cluster randomised trial. Employees were recruited from four mental health services prior to randomising three services to the intervention and one to no-intervention control. Intervention managers received a facilitated e-learning programme on work-related stress. Main outcomes were Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 12-item GHQ and sickness absence <21 days from human resources. 35 in-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, managers and employees, and additional observational data collected. Results: 424 of 649 (65%) employees approached consented, of whom 350 provided WEMWBS at baseline and 284 at follow-up; 41 managers out of 49 were recruited from the three intervention clusters and 21 adhered to the intervention. WEMWBS scores fell from 50.4-49.0 in the control (n=59) and 51.0-49.9 in the intervention (n=225), giving an intervention effect of 0.5 (95% CI-3.2 to 4.2). 120/225 intervention employees had a manager who was adherent to the intervention. HR data on sickness absence (n=393) showed no evidence of effect. There were no effects on GHQ score or work characteristics. Online quiz knowledge scores increased across the study in adherent managers. Qualitative data provided a rich picture of the context within which the intervention took place and managers' and employees' experiences of it. Conclusions: A small benefit from the intervention on well-being was explained by the mixed methods approach, implicating a low intervention uptake by managers and suggesting that education alone may be insufficient. A full trial of the guided e-learning intervention and economic evaluation is feasible. Future research should include more active encouragement of manager motivation, reflection and behaviour change. Trial Registration number: ISRCTN58661009.\",\n",
       "  '(0.728)  This study describes the development and usage of a Web-based component of a nutrition and physical activity behavioral intervention to promote bone health among preadolescent girls. Thirty Girl Scout troops were randomized to either an intervention or control group for a 2-year period. Girls in the intervention troops (aged 10 to 12 years, N=194) were exposed to grade-specific Web sites that were developed to reinforce the content of the broader, face-to-face intervention. In 5th grade, 82% of the girls logged on once and 48% logged on more than once, compared to 56% and 23% of 6th graders, respectively. Results suggest that although Web-site usage decreased over time, a Web-site program may be useful as a component of a face-to-face, multicomponent intervention. More research is needed to determine ways to enhance and maintain Web-site use over time among youth in health-behavior intervention programs.

Study Design Women presenting for surgical abortion who had chosen the transdermal patch for contraception were randomized to either delayed start of the patch (beginning the Sunday after their abortion) or immediate start (directly observed application of the patch in the clinic). Subjects were contacted at 2 and 6 months to assess contraceptive use. Results Two hundred ninety-eight women were randomized, and the follow-up rate was 71% at 2 months and 53% at 6 months. Method continuation did not differ by timing of initiation. At 2 months, 71% in the delayed-start group and 74% in the immediate-start group were using the patch [p=.6, with a difference of 3.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-17.2% to +11.2%]. At 6 months, 55% in the delayed-start group and 43% in the immediate-start group were using the patch (p=.13, with a difference of 11.9%, 95% CI=-19.2% to +34%). Conclusion Immediate initiation of the contraceptive patch after surgical abortion was not associated with increased use of patch at 2 or 6 months. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       "  '(0.756)  Purpose: To compare the efficacy of problem-solving therapy (PST) with supportive therapy (ST) to improve targeted vision function (TVF) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design: Single-masked, attention-controlled, randomized clinical trial with outcome assessments at 3 months (main trial endpoint) and 6 months (maintenance effects). Participants: Patients with AMD (n = 241) attending retina practices. Interventions: Whereas PST uses a structured problem-solving approach to reduce vision-related task difficulty, ST is a standardized attention-control treatment. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed TVF, the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire plus Supplement (NEI VFQ), the Activities Inventory (AI), and vision-related quality of life (QoL). Results: There were no between-group differences in TVF scores at 3 (P = 0.47) or 6 (P = 0.62) months. For PST subjects, mean ± standard deviation TVF scores improved from 2.71±0.52 at baseline to 2.18±0.88 at 3 months (P = 0.001) and were 2.18±0.95 at 6 months (change from 3 to 6 months, P = 0.74). For ST subjects, TVF scores improved from 2.73±0.52 at baseline to 2.14±0.96 at 3 months (P = 0.001) and were 2.15±0.96 at 6 months (change from 3 to 6 months, P = 0.85). Similar proportions of PST and ST subjects had less difficulty performing a TVF goal at 3 months (77.4% vs 78.6%, respectively; P = 0.83) and 6 months (76.2% vs 79.1%, respectively; P = 0.61). There were no changes in the NEI VFQ or AI. Vision-related QoL improved for PST relative to ST subjects at 3 months (F(4, 192) = 2.46; P = 0.05) and at 6 months (F(4, 178) = 2.55; P = 0.05). The PST subjects also developed more adaptive coping strategies than ST subjects. Conclusions: We found that PST was not superior to ST at improving vision function in patients with AMD, but that PST improved their vision-related QoL. Despite the benefits of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments, AMD remains associated with disability, depression, and diminished QoL. This clinical reality necessitates new rehabilitative interventions to improve the vision function and QoL of older persons with AMD. © 2013 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Published by Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       "  \"(0.723)  A preliminary cross-sectional study of 72 Hong Kong Chinese infants suggested that these infants learn to roll from supine-to-prone before rolling from prone-to-supine i.e. the opposite to teaching in most western texts. Three-hundred and sixty mothers were recruited postpartum and asked to record, on a chart, information related to the developmental milestone of rolling over for their infants (49% male) during the next 9 months. Telephone reminders were given at 4 and 8 months and, by the end of the study, information had been obtained from 240 mothers (67% of original sample, 51% male infants). Mean ages of rolling over were 5.1 months (SD1.5) for supine-to-prone and 5.7 months (SD1.3) for prone-to-supine. Age of rolling over from supine-to-prone was not influenced by usual sleep position, infant's sex, mother's intention to breastfeed infant, number of siblings, marital status, main daytime caregiver, or feeding method over 9 months.

       "  '(0.673)  Purpose: This study evaluated whether e-cigarette trial among Mexican adolescents increased the likelihood of trial and use of conventional cigarettes or marijuana use at follow-up. Method: A school-based longitudinal survey was conducted in 60 public middle schools from the three largest cities in Mexico. Students (12\\x9613 years old) were surveyed in 2015 and followed up 20 months later (n = 6574). Generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate the association between e-cigarette trial at baseline and conventional cigarettes smoking and marijuana use at follow-up. Result: Adolescents who had tried e-cigarettes (but not cigarettes) at baseline were more likely to have tried conventional cigarettes at followup compared to adolescents who had tried neither e-cigarettes nor cigarettes (43% vs. 24%, respectively; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.70). We also found that adolescents who had tried both conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes at baseline were more likely to have tried marijuana at follow-up compared to adolescents who had tried neither tobacco product (20% vs. 4%, respectively; RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78\\x964.02). Trial of only e-cigarettes was not independently associated with marijuana use at followup. Conclusions: Adolescents who had tried e-cigarettes were more likely to have tried conventional cigarettes and marijuana 20 months later. Although e-cigarettes have been banned in Mexico, it is likely that additional policies and public health campaigns are needed to reduce adolescent use of e-cigarettes and its consequences.',\n",
       "  '(0.663)  Background and aims: Serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y meningococcal (MenACWY) conjugate vaccines are recommended for routine adolescent immunisation in the United States and Canada. We evaluated the persistence of bactericidal antibodies through early childhood, following infant immunisation with varying schedules of MenACWY-CRM 197 vaccine. Methods: UK and Canadian infants were immunised with 2-3 doses of MenACWY-CRM 197 or 2 doses of serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) conjugate vaccine, and either MenACWY-CRM 197, 1/5 dose of MenACWY polysaccharide vaccine or no booster at 12 months. Control groups recruited at 60 months had received country-specific infant doses of MenC conjugate vaccine. hSBA titres were measured in participants at 40 and 60 months of age. Results: 382 children were enrolled in 12 groups (22-40 per group). By age 60 months, 3-11% of children primed and boosted with MenACWY-CRM 197 had hSBA titres=1:8 against serogroup A, 14-45% against serogroup C, 57-85% against serogroup W-135 and 42-71% against serogroup Y. Children primed with MenC and boosted with MenACWY-CRM 197 had similar results, except for serogroup C (59%). In age-matched controls administered MenC vaccine at 2, 3, and 4 months (UK), 2 and 12 months or 12 months only (Canada), percentages with hSBA titres=1:8 were 0-3%, 29-53%, 34-36% and 10-29% against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y respectively. Conclusions: Serogroup-specific bactericidal antibody wane following infant immunisation with MenACWY-CRM 197, most markedly against serogroup A. Best persistence against serogroup C is observed with MenC conjugate vaccine priming and MenACWY-CRM 197 at 12 months, compared to schedules using only MenACWY-CRM 197, with the potential for providing broader protection compared to monovalent MenC vaccines alone. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.'],\n",

About 300,000 were physicians, and another 100,000 were nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Yet primary care faces a growing crisis, in part because increasing numbers of U.S. medical graduates are avoiding careers in adult primary care. Sixty-five million Americans live in what are officially deemed primary care shortage areas, and adults throughout the United States face difficulty obtaining prompt access to primary care. A variety of strategies are being tried to improve primary care access, even without a large increase in the primary care workforce. ©2010 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.',\n",

Policy efforts have focused on increasing primary care PA supply, but low labor market demand might be constricting the primary care PA pipeline. Method: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we compare primary care and specialty job postings to each other and to occupied PA positions. Job posting data for 2014 are from a leading labor analytics firm. Results: Only 18% of job postings were in primary care, compared with 27% of occupied PA positions. The proportion of postings that were for primary care varied widely by state (9% to 40%) and were highest in the West. Discussion: Job availability is a potential barrier to PAs practicing in primary care, especially in some locations. Other job factors are examined and policy solutions are suggested.',\n",

Methods Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative\\x92s framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.00\\x960.49, 0.50\\x960.74 and 0.75\\x961.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively. Findings Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4%), management and organization (91; 12%) and primary care functions (43; 5%). Although about 91% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23% of the entire population \\x96 including just 5% of the rural population \\x96 had access to primary care of good quality. Conclusion Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas.

Studies reviewed: Research publications relevant to comprehensive primary care and authored by researchers from primary care, recorded in Medline and Embase, with publication dates 2001-7 inclusive. Main outcome measures: Volume of published activity of generalist primary care researchers and the quality of the research output by those publishing the most using citation metrics: numbers of cited papers, proportion of cited papers, and mean citation scores. Results: 82 169 papers published between 2001 and 2007 in the six countries were classified as research on primary care. In a 15% pragmatic random sample of these records, 40% of research on primary care from the United Kingdom and 46% from the Netherlands was authored by researchers employed in a primary care setting or employed in academic departments of primary care. The 141 researchers with the highest volume of publications reporting research findings published between 2001 and 2007 (inclusive) authored or part authored 8.3% of the total sample of papers. For authors with the highest proportion of publications cited at least five times, the best performers came from the United States (n=5), United Kingdom (n=4), and the Netherlands (n=2). In the top 10 of authors with the highest proportions of publications achieving 20 or more citations, six were from the United Kingdom and four from the United States. The mean Hirsch index (measure of a researcher's productivity and impact of the published work) was 14 for the Netherlands, 13 for the United Kingdom, 12 for the United States, 7 for Canada, 4 for Australia, and 3 for Germany.

       " ['(0.778)  Summary: The use of sodium bisulfite (BS) treatment followed by hybridization to an Illumina Infinium BeadChip (HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC) is a common method for interrogating 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at single nucleotide resolution. However, standard treatment of DNA with BS does not allow disambiguation of 5mC from an additional cytosine modification, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Recently, it has been demonstrated that paired BS and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) treatment on the same sample followed by hybridization to an Infinium microarray permits the differentiation of 5hmC from 5mC. Nevertheless, estimation of 5hmC and 5mC from tandem-treated arrays has been shown to produce irregular estimates of cytosine modifications. Results: We present a novel method using maximum likelihood estimation to accurately estimate the parameters of unmethylated cytosine (5C), 5mC and 5hmC from Infinium microarray data given the signal intensities from the oxBS and BS replicates.',\n",
       "  '(0.753)  A lack of strategy to counteract hypoxia (pO2 < 10\\x9615 mmHg) and technique to repeatedly measure tumor pO2 has restricted therapeutic optimization. We report the results obtained with an innovative anti-angiogenic strategy of recurrent low-dose (metronomic) chemotherapy to modulate hypoxia and growth of the Head and Neck tumor xenografts. The FaDu tumors were established in the fl ank of immune defi cient mice and EPR oximetry with lithium phthalocyanine crystals was used to follow the temporal changes in tumor pO2 on treatment with gemcitabine including controls for three weeks. The FaDu tumors were hypoxic with a baseline (pre-treatment) pO2 of 2\\x968 mmHg. A transient increase in the tumor pO2 was evident on day 3 on treatment with a conventional schedule of gemcitabine (150 mg/kg, d1, d8, d15). No signifi cant change in the tumor pO2 on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine (25 mg/kg on d1, d3, d5 for 3 weeks) was observed. However, tumor pO2 increased signifi cantly on d15\\x96d18 during treatment with a metronomic schedule of 15 mg/kg gemcitabine (d1, d3, d5 for 3 weeks). A modest decrease in the tumor growth was evident on treatment with conventional gemcitabine. Notably, tumor growth was signifi cantly inhibited by metronomic (25 and 15 mg/kg) gemcitabine treatment. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of the tumor samples indicate a decrease in HIF-1a and TSP-1 on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine. In conclusion, a signifi cant inhibition of tumor growth on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine was observed; however, the increase in pO2 was dose dependent. EPR oximetry can be used to follow the temporal changes in tumor pO2 to identify a therapeutic window on treatment with metronomic chemotherapy for potential combination with radiotherapy.',\n",

       "  '(0.641)  This study examines how different types of health coverage influence the likelihood of entering treatment for an alcohol problem, and the extent that people in treatment are able to use their insurance to help cover the costs of care. Survey data are analyzed from a sample of problem drinkers drawn from the general population and chemical dependency treatment programs in the same community. We find that, in comparison to being on Medicaid and being uninsured, having private coverage does not significantly alter the odds of treatment entry. Being in a private managed care plan, as compared to traditional indemnity coverage, also does not appear to impact the chances of treatment entry. However, having private coverage, as compared to being on Medicare, doubles the odds of treatment entry. For problem drinkers who obtain treatment, those with private coverage are as or more likely than other insured groups to report that insurance helped to pay treatment expenses. Even so, 10% of those privately insured report having paid for all of their treatment costs out of pocket. We conclude that, while prior studies have rarely found that having insurance significantly impacts alcohol treatment entry, the type of coverage one possesses may matter in some cases. Our results concerning Medicare coverage may point to potential problems with making treatment affordable to some problem drinkers outside the private insurance system. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

       "  '(0.636)  Metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment is associated with anti-angiogenic activity and is anticipated to generate exploitable hypoxia using hypoxia-activated prodrugs. Weekly administration of tirapazamine (TPZ; 5 mg/kg body weight i.p.) failed to inhibit the growth of 9L gliosarcoma tumors grown s.c. in scid mice. However, the anti-tumor effect of weekly cyclophosphamide (CPA) treatment (140 mg/kg BW i.p.) was substantially enhanced by weekly TPZ administration. An extended tumor free period and increased frequency of tumor eradication without overt toxicity were observed when TPZ was given 3, 4 or 5 days after each weekly CPA treatment. Following the 2nd CPA injection, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Oximetry indicated significant increases in tumor pO2, starting at 48 hr, which further increased after the 3rd CPA injection. pO2 levels were, however, stable in growing untreated tumors. A strong negative correlation (-0.81) between tumor pO2 and tumor volume during 21 days of weekly CPA chemotherapy was observed, indicating increasing tumor pO2 with decreasing tumor volume. Furthermore, CPA treatment resulted in increased tumor uptake of activated CPA. CPA induced increases in VEGF RNA, which reached a maximum on day 1, and in PLGF RNA which was sustained throughout the treatment, while anti-angiogenic host thrombospondin-1 increased dramatically through day 7 post-CPA treatment. Weekly cyclophosphamide treatment was anticipated to generate exploitable hypoxia. However, our findings suggest that weekly CPA treatment induces a functional improvement of tumor vasculature, which is characterized by increased tumor oxygenation and drug uptake in tumors, thus counter-intuitively, benefiting intratumoral activation of TPZ and perhaps other bioreductive drugs. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.'],\n",
       " [\"(0.65)  This paper shows how the theory of symbolic interactionism shaped a grounded investigation of the organizational labor of Australian Emergency Department (ED) clinicians. Further, it shows how symbolic interactionism supports reflexive criteria for validating grounded research. Using ethnographic methods across two metropolitan EDs, interactionism's emphasis on roles applied equally to the relationship between researcher and participants as to the relationships among participants. Specifically, the researcher generated data by positioning interactionism as the mediator of the emergent relationship between researcher and participants. The results of this positioning were: a traceable path from understanding to interpretation and the search for consequentiality rather than truth. Interactionism facilitated the co-production by the researcher and participants of limits on the generalizability of the data. The paper is an argument for symbolic interactionism as a means not merely to generate sociological findings, but to conceptualize the impact of the researcher on the grounded research process. © 2005-2008 Qualitative Sociology Review.\",\n",

However, to facilitate this, we must tailor components of the HIVST kit and process to ensure that we reach and encourage youth to test. The purpose of this study to elucidate concerns and issues regarding HIVST rollout among South African youth. Methods: This study was conducted in two phases: 1) focus group discussions with rural, South African youth aged 18-24 and 2) direct observations of participants completing with an oral HIVST kit and/or a blood based HIVST kit. In phase 2a participants were invited to try both an oral and blood-based HIVST kit. In phase 2b, participants selected the HIVST kit of their choice. Results: We enrolled 35 unique participants in phase 1, 20 participants in phase 2a, and 40 participants in phase 2b. While the focus group discussions highlighted hypothetical HIVST use only, participants appreciated the privacy that the HIVST could afford them. However, they expressed concerns about whether HIVST could be trusted due to false positives and negatives, as well as whether a person would be able to emotionally handle the results if they tested alone. They suggested that the kits be used alongside someone who could provide support. In phases 2a and 2b, participants were overwhelmingly positive about both kits regarding ease of use and whether their results could be trusted. The participants, however, experienced more challenges with the blood-based versus oral test. When given the choice in phase 2b, most participants (80%) chose the oral HIVST over the blood-based HIVST. Conclusions: During the focus group discussions, participants raised concerns about the validity of HIVST, lack of emotional support when testing alone, and the cost of HIVST kits, all of which could be addressed through current testing campaigns. Most of those who actually tested had positive experiences with HIVST and would recommend it to their friends. When offered a choice, most preferred the oral test.

This article attempts to shed some light on this issue by studying the question design during the direct examination in an American criminal court case using Conversation Analysis. It shows that attorneys use different question forms compared to casual conversation: declaratives are far less prevalent and questions are often designed as requests for action. In addition, attorneys make use of forms that are not found in other types of interaction, such as the tag (is that) correct. The way in which attorneys design their questions additionally shows that the rules of the courtroom have procedural consequences for how the interaction is done. But these rules have to be enacted, and it is in their violation that participants bring about categories such as leading questions.',\n",

Study Design During personal interviews, participants considered four EOL scenarios, each presenting a choice between a less intense and more intense care option. Data Collection Participants selected their initially favored option. Depending on that choice, in the subsequent TT the length of life offered by the more intense option was systematically increased or decreased until the participant \"switched\" to his or her initially rejected option. Principal Findings Participants were able to select an initially favored option (in 3 of the 4 scenarios; this was the less intense option). The majority of participants were able to engage with the subsequent TT. In all scenarios, regardless of the increase/decrease in the length of life offered by the more intense option, the majority of participants were unwilling to \"switch\" to their initially rejected option.

Practicing multiple concepts together (mixed practice mode) has been shown superior to practicing concepts separately (blocked practice mode) for transfer. This study examined the effect of single and multiple practice contexts for both mixed and blocked practice modalities on transfer performance. We looked at performance on near transfer (familiar contexts) cases and far transfer (unfamiliar contexts) cases. First year psychology students (n\\xa0=\\xa042) learned three physiological concepts in a 2\\xa0×\\xa02 factorial study (one or two practice contexts and blocked or mixed practice). Each concept was practiced with two clinical cases; practice context was defined as the number of organ systems used (one system per concept vs. two systems). In blocked practice, two practice cases followed each concept; in mixed practice, students learned all concepts before seeing six practice cases. Transfer testing consisted of correctly classifying and explaining 15 clinical cases involving near and far transfer. The outcome was ratings of quality of explanations on a 0\\x963 scale. The repeated measures analysis showed a significant near versus far by organ system interaction [F(1,38)\\xa0=\\xa03.4, p\\xa0<\\xa00.002] with practice with a single context showing lower far transfer scores than near transfer [0.58 (0.37)\\x960.83 (0.37)] compared to the two contexts which had similar far and near transfer scores [1.19 (0.50)\\x961.01 (0.38)].

It outlines the broad ethical principles that underpin good research and the aspects of ethical practice that qualitative researchers are especially likely to need to consider when designing, conducting, and disseminating their research. The chapter explains ways of thinking about research ethics, beginning with some overarching philosophical principles, before moving on to discuss situational and relational aspects of ethical research practice. Formal codes of ethics, and practice guidelines developed by professional bodies and institutions, highlight three core concerns that researchers working with human subjects should attend to, namely: informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymity.

       "  '(0.642)  Objectives The aim of the present secondary analysis of data collected in a grounded theory study was to explore the perceptions of Registrars and new Fellows to practice ownership and management. Methods Focus groups and interviews with Registrars and recent Fellows were undertaken to explore the desire to become an owner, facilitators and barriers to practice ownership and delivery models for practice ownership education. A secondary thematic analysis was conducted to understand emerging concepts related to perceptions of general practice ownership. Results A surprisingly strong theme of fear was evident across focus group and interview participants. Expressed fear was specifically related to financial concerns, lack of relevant knowledge and skills and concern over balancing different roles. Moderating factors included previous life and educational experiences, as well as role modelling. Conclusions Graduation of a cohort of new general practitioners (GPs) who express fear towards practice ownership is concerning. Creating more positive learning environments and opportunity for open discussion regarding practice management and ownership is an important step in providing adequate support for new GPs to give serious consideration to career options. What is known about the topic? The traditional model of general practice ownership has been for a doctor to own and/or manage the practice. Fewer new GPs are taking on the role of owning a general practice, and disinterest has been presumed to play a significant role in this trend. It has been reported that current curricula provide insufficient focus on providing learning opportunities for general practice trainees on ownership and management models; however, recent research has shown that general practice trainees have a strong interest in receiving this knowledge during their training. What does this paper add? The present qualitative research evaluated the emotional response that general practice trainees (Registrars) expressed when they considered practice ownership. GP Registrars expressed fear when asked about the prospect of owning their own practice. This may be influenced by the role modelling they receive during their training. What are the implications for practitioners? Supervisors involved in general practice training should ensure their trainees have the opportunity to learn about practice ownership during their training. Supervisors should also be aware that their own behaviour and attitudes towards practice ownership is observed by their trainees and it can colour the emotional response the trainee has when considering owning a practice.'],\n",

Methods: Data was prospectively collected from 12,661 patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization between July 1998 and July 2006. Patients were divided into three cohorts based upon the degree of hematocrit change: drop greater than 6, drop between 3 and 6, and drop less than 3. In-hospital major adverse events, 30-day mortality, and long-term all-cause mortality were recorded. Results: Patients with larger reductions in hematocrit were more likely to be older, female, and have a higher baseline hematocrit, present with acute myocardial infarction, develop cardiogenic shock, require emergent catheterization, develop retroperitoneal bleeds and large hematomas, receive transfusions, have longer index hospitalizations, develop subacute stent thrombosis, and have higher 30-day and long-term mortality. An increase in long-term mortality was observed with progressive hematocrit drop. This finding is largely driven by early (30 day) mortality, as trends were no longer significant after rezeroing mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were identified as independent predictors of near and long-term mortality. Conclusions: Periprocedural bleeding, defined by hematocrit drop, is associated with increased near-term and long-term mortality in patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization procedures. Long-term mortality is largely driven by up front 30-day mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent predictor for near-term mortality.

AAA-related reinterventions are more common after EVAR, whereas laparotomy-related reinterventions are more common after open repair. The effect of reinterventions on survival, however, is unknown. We therefore evaluated the rate of reinterventions and readmission after initial AAA repair, 30-day mortality, and the effect on long-term survival. Methods We identified AAA-related and laparotomy-related reinterventions for propensity score-matched cohorts of 45,652 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR and open repair from 2001 to 2004. Follow-up was up to 6 years. Hospitalizations for ruptured AAA without repair and for bowel obstruction or ventral hernia without abdominal surgery were also recorded. Event rates were calculated per year and are presented through 6 years of follow-up as events per 100 person-years. Thirty-day mortality was calculated for each reintervention or readmission. Results Through 6 years, overall reinterventions or readmissions were similar between repair methods but slightly more common after EVAR (7.6 vs 7.0/100 person-years; relative risk [RR], 1.1; P < .001). Overall 30-day mortality with any reintervention or readmission was 9.1%. EVAR patients had more ruptures (0.50 vs 0.09 [RR, 5.7; P < .001]), with a mortality of 28%, but these were uncommon. EVAR patients also had more AAA-related reinterventions through 6 years (3.7 vs 0.9 [RR, 4.0; P < .001]; mortality, 5.6%), most of which were minor endovascular reinterventions (2.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 11.4; P < .001]), with a 30-day mortality of 3.0%. However, minor open (0.8 vs 0.5 [RR, 1.4; P < .001]; mortality, 6.9%) and major reinterventions (0.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 2.4; P < .001]; mortality, 12.1%) were also more common after EVAR than open repair. Conversely, EVAR patients had fewer laparotomy-related reinterventions than open patients (1.4 vs 3.0 [RR, 0.5; P < .001]; mortality, 8.1%) and readmissions without surgery (2.0 vs 2.7 [RR, 0.7; P < .001]; mortality 10.9%). Overall, reinterventions or readmission accounted for 9.6% of all EVAR deaths and 7.6% of all open repair deaths in the follow-up period (P < .001). Conclusions Reintervention and readmission are slightly higher after EVAR. Survival is negatively affected by reintervention or readmission after EVAR and open surgery, which likely contributes to the erosion of the survival benefit of EVAR over time. © 2011 Society for Vascular Surgery.',\n",

       "  '(0.541)  Background. There is no consensus on the optimal period during which to assess death after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Three measures are commonly used: in-hospital, 30-day, and procedural (either in-hospital or 30-day) mortality. We used a regional database to calculate the CABG mortality rate using each of these mortality measures. Methods. Data were collected prospectively on 31,592 consecutive isolated CABG surgeries in northern New England between January 1992 and December 2001. These data were linked to the National Death Index to obtain vital status through December 2001, and used to calculate 30-day and procedural mortality rates. Procedural mortality was defined as death occurring either within the hospital setting or within 30 days of the index procedure. Regional registry data were used to calculate in-hospital mortality rates. Results. Mortality rates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. In all but one medical center, the in-hospital mortality was the lowest rate, while in all centers the procedural mortality rate was the highest. There were 1,082 deaths captured by the procedural mortality measure. Of these, 927 were included in the in-hospital mortality measure; 956 occurred within 30 days of surgery. Conclusions. Each of the measures studied has its advantages and may be used to assess the mortality outcomes of cardiac surgery. The more important issue other than the specific measure used is our ability to measure and validate it conveniently and accurately in actual practice. © 2006 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.',\n",
       "  '(0.5)  What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks? Background: Following a century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking. Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images. Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing ~68.9% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors. Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age. Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions.'],\n",
       " ['(0.62)  Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour \\x96 whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions \\x96 education, regulation and material incentivisation \\x96 largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context-dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.',\n",
       "  '(0.607)  Much of the global burden of non-communicable disease is caused by unhealthy behaviours that individuals enact even when informed of their health-harming consequences. A key insight is that these behaviours are not predominantly driven by deliberative conscious decisions, but occur directly in response to environmental cues and without necessary representation of their consequences. Consequently, interventions that target non-conscious rather than conscious processes to change health behaviour may have significant potential, but this important premise remains largely untested. This is in part due to the lack of a practicable conceptual framework that can be applied to better describe and assess these interventions. We propose a framework for describing or categorising interventions to change health behaviour by the degree to which their effects may be considered non-conscious. Potential practical issues with applying such a framework are discussed, as are the implications for further research to inform the testing and development of interventions. A pragmatic means of conceptualising interventions targeted at non-conscious processes is a necessary prelude to testing the potency of such interventions. This can ultimately inform the development of interventions with the potential to shape healthier behaviours across populations.',\n",
       "  '(0.577)  Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a country\\x92s health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions. Results Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 80\\x9695) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 90\\x9697), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89\\x96100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 84\\x9693). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen. Conclusion Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed.',\n",

A key aspect of this is reducing unwarranted variation and addressing both the underuse of high-value interventions and the overuse of low-value interventions. In the context of end-of-life care, high-value interventions are those that enhance quality of life. In contrast, low-value interventions are those that are futile, those that negatively impact on quality of life, and those that are not in line with the person's wishes.

       "  '(0.534)  Background: \"Nudging\" - modifying environments to change people\\'s behavior, often without their conscious awareness - can improve health, but public acceptability of nudging is largely unknown. Methods: We compared acceptability, in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA), of government interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Three nudge interventions were assessed: i. reducing portion Size, ii. changing the Shape of the drink containers, iii. changing their shelf Location; alongside two traditional interventions: iv. Taxation and v. Education. We also tested the hypothesis that describing interventions as working through non-conscious processes decreases their acceptability. Predictors of acceptability, including perceived intervention effectiveness, were also assessed. Participants (n = 1093 UK and n = 1082 USA) received a description of each of the five interventions which varied, by randomisation, in how the interventions were said to affect behaviour: (a) via conscious processes; (b) via non-conscious processes; or (c) no process stated. Acceptability was derived from responses to three items. Results: Levels of acceptability for four of the five interventions did not differ significantly between the UK and US samples; reducing portion size was less accepted by the US sample. Within each country, Education was rated as most acceptable and Taxation the least, with the three nudge-type interventions rated between these. There was no evidence to support the study hypothesis: i.e. stating that interventions worked via non-conscious processes did not decrease their acceptability in either the UK or US samples. Perceived effectiveness was the strongest predictor of acceptability for all interventions across the two samples. Conclusion: In conclusion, nudge interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages seem similarly acceptable in the UK and USA, being more acceptable than taxation, but less acceptable than education. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that highlighting the non-conscious processes by which nudge interventions may work decreases their acceptability. However, highlighting the effectiveness of all interventions has the potential to increase their acceptability.'],\n",
       " ['(0.788)  This research examined the role of movie portrayals of smoking as well as peer, parent, and sibling smoking as predictors of intentions to smoke and smoking behavior in adolescents. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of a model that proposes that identification with smokers, normative beliefs about smoking, and positive expectations about smoking are mediators of the association between social influences and smoking intentions. Our models provided a good fit for both a cross-sectional model of smoking and a model of smoking initiation. The relationship between media exposure to smoking and intentions to smoke was mediated by positive expectancies and identification as a smoker in the cross-sectional model, and by positive expectancies in baseline neversmokers. Our results indicate that viewing smoking in movies is an important predictor of smoking among adolescents and that identity processes and expectancies serve as mediators of this effect.

       "  \"(0.764)  BACKGROUND. Several studies have linked seeing smoking in movies with adolescent smoking, but none have determined how much movie smoking adolescents see. OBJECTIVE. Our aim was to determine exposure to movie smoking in a representative sample of young US adolescents. METHODS. We surveyed 6522 nationally representative US adolescents aged 10-14 years. We content analyzed 534 contemporary box-office hits for movie smoking. Each movie was assigned to a random subsample of adolescents (mean: 613) who were asked whether they had seen the movie. Using survey weights, we estimated the total number of US adolescents who had seen each movie and then multiplied by the number of smoking depictions in each movie to obtain gross smoking impressions seen by adolescents. RESULTS. The 534 movies were mainly rated PG-13 (41%) and R (40%), and 74% contained smoking (3830 total smoking occurrences). On average, each movie was seen by 25% of the adolescents surveyed. Viewership was higher with increased age and lower for R-rated movies. Overall, these movies delivered 13.9 billion gross smoking impressions, an average of 665 to each US adolescent aged 10-14 years. Although this sample's R-rated movies contained 60% of smoking occurrences, they delivered only 39% of smoking impressions because of lower adolescent viewership. Thirty popular movies each delivered =100 million gross smoking impressions. Thirty actors each delivered >50 million smoking impressions, such that just 1.5% of actors delivered one quarter of all character smoking to the adolescent sample. CONCLUSIONS. Popular movies deliver billions of smoking images and character smoking depictions to young US adolescents. Removing smoking from youth-rated films would substantially reduce exposure from new box-office hits. Furthermore, the popular actors who frequently smoke in movies could have a major impact on adolescent movie smoking exposure by choosing not to portray characters who smoke.

       "  '(0.73)  In this paper the utility of the concept of craving in the explanation of smoking behaviour both in abstinence and in the resumption of smoking is explored. The experience of craving is suggested to be one of the foremost symptoms of withdrawal, and a major cause of relapse, and yet there is no standardised tool for measuring craving, neither has any agreement ever been reached concerning the precise meaning of the term. Estimates of the prevalence of craving vary widely. Predictions of craving during abstinence have focused on pre-cessation smoking habits, but evidence implies that high pre-cessation craving leads to high craving during abstinence, and has also suggested that craving can be maintained by smoking. Pharmacological aids used to relieve craving in smoking cessation have not had convincing results, and psychological and motivational aspects and expectancies may also play a part in generating craving. Questions relating to the concept of craving in need of attention in research are highlighted and future directions for research recommended.',\n",

Methods: Anatural experiment was conducted in a multiplex cinema. We conducted exit interviews with 4,073 movie patrons, of whom 645 (16%) were smokers. Eleven per cent (n = 69) of the smokers were aged 14 to 17 years old. Subjects had exited 26 movies, of which 12 (46%) contained smoking. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear regression to assess the effects of (a) exposure to movie smoking (yes vs. no), and (b) age (adolescent vs. adult smokers) on general attitude towards smoking and intention to quit smoking within the next 6 months (both scales ranged 0-10). Results: Smokers who saw a movie with smoking had more favourable attitudes towards smoking than those seeing a movie without smoking (p = 0.004). A significant interaction between age group and movie smoking indicated that this difference was more pronounced in adolescent smokers (p = 0.035). No significant differences were found for intentions to quit smoking. Conclusions: Study results suggest that smoking in the movies may influence young smokers to have a more favorable attitude towards smoking. © 2012 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.\"],\n",

Better clinical markers would facilitate discrimination and prioritization for genetic testing between diabetes subtypes. Serum 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) levels were reported to differentiate maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A mutations (HNF1A-MODY) from type 2 diabetes, but this requires further validation. We evaluated serum 1,5AG in a range of diabetes subtypes as an adjunct for defining diabetes etiology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - 1,5AG was measured in U.K. subjects with: HNF1A-MODY (n = 23), MODY due to glucokinase mutations (GCK-MODY, n = 23), type 1 diabetes (n = 29), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA, n = 42), and type 2 diabetes (n = 206). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess discriminative accuracy of 1,5AG for diabetes etiology. RESULTS - Mean (SD range) 1,5AG levels were: GCK-MODY 13.06 µg/ml (5.74-29.74), HNF1A-MODY 4.23 µg/ml (2.12-8.44), type 1 diabetes 3.09 µg/ml (1.45-6.57), LADA 3.46 µg/ml (1.42-8.45), and type 2 diabetes 5.43 (2.12-13.23). Levels in GCK-MODY were higher than in other groups (P < 10-4 vs. each group). HNF1A-MODY subjects showed no difference in unadjusted 1,5AG levels from type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and LADA. Adjusting for A1C revealed a difference between HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001). The discriminative accuracy of unadjusted 1,5AG levels was 0.79 for GCK-MODY versus type 2 diabetes and 0.86 for GCK-MODY versus HNF1A-MODY but was only 0.60 for HNF1A-MODY versus type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS - In our dataset, serum 1,5AG performed well in discriminating GCK-MODY from other diabetes subtypes, particularly HNF1A-MODY. Measurement of 1,5AG levels could inform decisions regarding MODY diagnostic testing. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.',\n",

Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study, a systematic approach was used to search YouTube videos with a title, description or content specifically about diabetes burnout dated between 2007 and 2017. Irrelevant or duplicated videos were excluded using eligibility criteria. All videos meeting inclusion criteria (n = 32) from individuals with Type 1 diabetes were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse video characteristics. Results: The four major themes associated with diabetes burnout were: (i) feeling mentally drained and physically tired of dealing with self-care; (ii) experiencing a detachment from self, diabetes care and support system; (iii) being powerless and paralysed to \\x91climb out\\x92 of diabetes burnout; and (iv) contributing potential factors to diabetes burnout. Conclusions: Self-descriptions of diabetes burnout suggest that it is a combination of emotions and behaviours on a spectrum from exhaustion to detachment accompanied by an overwhelming sense of powerlessness.

To explore patients' responses to developing and managing cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and to contrast their views with those of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Background. The incidence of diabetes among people with cystic fibrosis has increased with improvement in life expectancy. However, little is known about how patients respond to and manage cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, and how this compares with people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Design. Qualitative research was undertaken in order to fully explore meanings and views. Methods. Semi-structured telephone or face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients who had cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or type 1 diabetes mellitus, during which, they discussed diagnosis and management of diabetes. Framework analysis was employed to identify themes and to consider similarities and differences between the two groups. Results. Eleven cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and 12 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients were interviewed in 2006. Patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes described their diabetes diagnosis as a progression of their primary illness, management of which was important owing to the benefits it brought to their cystic fibrosis. Those with type 1 diabetes mellitus were more likely to report feeling psychologically low because of diabetes and to list long-term complications as a key factor motivating self-management. Both groups struggled to balance the demands of diabetes with other life and health obligations, and experienced isolation because of diabetes. Conclusions. Variation in perceptions recalled during interviews stemmed from diabetes being part of an existing life-threatening chronic illness in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Similarities and differences in attitudes and management practices were found, with less urgency regarding glucose monitoring and fewer information resources available for those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Relevance to clinical practice. Both groups need support for optimal diabetes management and access to appropriate resources outside specialist clinics. Web-based technologies could prove useful for those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes as face-to-face interaction may be prevented owing to the risk of cross-infection. © 2008 The Authors.\",\n",

Inappropriate language has a negative impact on self-efficacy, well-being and confidence of people living with diabetes, can seriously undermine experiences with health-care providers and, more broadly, can contribute to diabetes stigma. To date, Diabetes Canada has had no formal position to facilitate positive and affirming attitudes towards diabetes, which is reflected by the use of more appropriate language around diabetes. This consensus statement was developed by Diabetes Canada, by a working group comprised of health-care professionals and lived experience subject matter experts (LESME: patient partners) and validated by volunteers from Diabetes Canada's Professional Section and Diabetes Action Canada's Patient Circles. The principles outlined in this document will be valuable in three broad domains: 1) Diabetes Canada's internal and external communications, 2) increasing public awareness of diabetes and reduction of stigma around diabetes and 3) enhancing the health, wellness and self-efficacy of persons living with diabetes. A major strategy to effect change in this third domain will be to disseminate these concepts broadly among all current (and future) health-care professionals to help integrate positive and supportive attitudes in everyday clinical practice.\",\n",

BMI was ascertained at regular intervals before and during the follow-up. RESULTS - Between 1984-1992 and 1999-2007, the age-adjusted hazard of type 2 diabetes more than doubled (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI 1.75-3.10]). Mean BMI rose by 1.42 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.10-1.74) between 1984 and 1999; this could explain 26% (95% CI 17-38) of the type 2 diabetes increase. CONCLUSIONS - An appreciable portion of the rise in type 2 diabetes can be attributed to BMI changes. A substantial portion remains unexplained, possibly associated with other determinants such as physical activity. This merits further research. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.'],\n",

Population-based rates of admission to hospital, bed days and costs were all significantly related to census tract income (p<0.01 for males and females). The number of admissions per person admitted was significantly associated with census tract income (p<0.01 for males and females), but length of stay and resource intensity weight were not. Hospital costs were 50.0% higher for the poorest quintile of neighbourhoods than for the wealthiest and 35.8% higher than for the middle-income quintile.

       "  '(0.563)  Background: Institutional deaths (hospitals and nursing homes) are an important issue because they are often at odds with patient preference and associated with high healthcare costs. The aim of this study was to examine deaths in institutions and the role of individual, regional, and healthcare supply characteristics in explaining variation across Swiss Hospital Service Areas (HSAs). Methods: Retrospective study of individuals =66 years old who died in a Swiss institution (hospital or nursing homes) in 2010. Using a two-level logistic regression analysis we examined the amount of variation across HSAs adjusting for individual, regional and healthcare supply measures. The outcome was place of death, defined as death in hospital or nursing homes. Results: In 2010, 41,275 individuals =66 years old died in a Swiss institution; 54 % in nursing homes and 46 % in hospitals. The probability of dying in hospital decreased with increasing age. The OR was 0.07 (95 % CI: 0.05-0.07) for age 91+ years compared to those 66-70 years. Living in peri-urban areas (OR = 1.06 95 % CI: 1.00-1.11) and French speaking region (OR = 1.43 95 % CI: 1.22-1.65) was associated with higher probability of hospital death.

There have been reports of patients found dead from drug poisoning on the hospital premises or shortly after leaving the hospital. This study examines whether hospital admission and discharge are associated with increased risk of opioid-related death. Methods and findings We conducted a case-crossover study of opioid-related deaths in England. Our study included 13,609 deaths between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 among individuals aged 18 to 64. For each death, we sampled 5 control days from the period 730 to 28 days before death. We used data from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database to determine the time proximity of deaths and control days to hospital admissions. We estimated the association between hospital admission and opioid-related death using conditional logistic regression, with a reference category of time neither admitted to the hospital nor within 14 days of discharge. A total of 236/13,609 deaths (1.7%) occurred following drug use while admitted to the hospital. The risk during hospital admissions was similar or lower than periods neither admitted to the hospital nor recently discharged, with odds ratios 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; p = 0.75) for the first 14 days of an admission and 0.41 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.56; p < 0.001) for days 15 onwards. 1,088/13,609 deaths (8.0%) occurred in the 14 days after discharge. The risk of opioid-related death increased in this period, with odds ratios of 4.39 (95% CI 3.75 to 5.14; p < 0.001) on days 1 to 2 after discharge and 2.09 (95% CI 1.92 to 2.28; p < 0.001) on days 3 to 14. 11,629/13,609 deaths (85.5%) did not occur close to a hospital admission, and the remaining 656/13,609 deaths (4.8%) occurred in hospital following admission due to drug poisoning. Risk was greater for patients discharged from psychiatric admissions, those who left the hospital against medical advice, and those leaving the hospital after admissions of 7 days or more. The main limitation of the method is that it does not control for time-varying health or drug use within individuals; therefore, hospital admissions coinciding with high-risk periods may in part explain the results. Conclusions Discharge from the hospital is associated with an acute increase in the risk of opioid-related death, and 1 in 14 opioid-related deaths in England happens in the 2 weeks after the hospital discharge. This supports interventions that prevent early discharge and improve linkage with community drug treatment and harm reduction services.'],\n",

We studied madarsah enrolment among 53,960 representative households; 853 focus groups of parents discussed enrolment choices. In 2004, 2.6% of all children (3.8% of school-going children) aged 5-9 years attended a madarsah. Children from urban and less educated households were more likely to attend a madarsah, but there was no difference by sex of the child or household vulnerability.

Methods: In 2017, 100 population clusters within the Narayani Zone of Nepal were selected using RAAB software. Children (aged 0\\x9615 years) suspected of having visual problems were identified using Key Informants (KIs) and school teachers and were referred for ophthalmologic examination. Eye care staff actively sought children who failed to present for examination. Causes of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI were categorized using standard World Health Organization definitions. Results: Of 76,588 children selected, 72,900 (95%) were screened. Of 2,158 children referred for examination, 1,322 were referred by teachers and 836 by KIs. A total of 1,617 (75%) children received a detailed examination, of whom 128 children [65 girls (51%)] mean age of 9.4 (± 4.1 years) were confirmed to have BL 7 (5.5%), SVI 16 (12.5%), ModVI 19 (15%) or MildVI 86 (67%). The combined prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI was 175/100,000 (95% CI 172\\x96178/100,000); BL/SVI/ModVI was 55/100,000 (95% CI 53\\x9657/100,000) and the combined BL/SVI estimate was 30/100,000 (95% CI 29\\x9631/100,000). The leading causes of BL/SVI/MVI were refractive error 23 (55%) and whole globe disorders 5 (12%). Total avoidable causes were 31 (74%). Conclusion: The prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI among children in Narayani Zone was moderate and included a high proportion of avoidable and treatable cases.

       "  '(0.616)  This cross-sectional and exploratory study aimed to compare motor performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) attention levels in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and those with typical development, and determine the relationship between motor performance and the real-time EEG attention level in children with DCD. Eighty-six children with DCD [DCD: n=57; DCD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): n=29] and 99 children with typical development were recruited. Their motor performance was assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) and attention during the tasks of the MABC was evaluated by EEG. All children with DCD had higher MABC impairment scores and lower EEG attention scores than their peers (P<0.05). After accounting for age, sex, body mass index, and physical activity level, the attention index remained significantly associated with the MABC total impairment score and explained 14.1% of the variance in children who had DCD but not ADHD (P=0.009) and 17.5% of the variance in children with both DCD and ADHD (P=0.007). Children with DCD had poorer motor performance and were less attentive to movements than their peers. Their poor motor performance may be explained by inattention.'],\n",

The study focused on two individual semantic features, namely \"size\" and \"relative position\" and identified each and every instance of these in 180 narrations and analyzed whether these were encoded in speech, in gesture, or in speech and gesture. \\'Importance\\' was assessed by asking ten judges (per story) to identify the five most important instances of \"size\" and the five most important instances of \"relative position\" and this was used, employing various statistical algorithms, to calibrate the significance of each element of the story. The study found that overall gestures were significantly more likely to encode high importance information than medium or low importance information. This was also found with the semantic feature \"size\" considered on its own but there was a reversal of this trend when \"relative position\" information was considered separately. An explanation is offered for this reversal in terms of the way that gestures encode position information in the first place.',\n",

This study examines whether anxiety increases the gender gap in risk-seeking, whereas sadness closes the gender gap in risk-seeking, a pattern we call the Emotional Fluctuation Effect. In two studies, one with an adolescent sample and the other employing an adult sample, we find similar levels of risk-seeking when males are in anxious or sad states. By contrast, anxious females are less riskseeking than anxious males (study 1 and study 2), and anxious adolescent girls are less risk-seeking than sad adolescent girls (study 1).

There have been calls for new social theory on this \\x91under-theorized\\x92 topic. Presenting such further reflections, I argue that Douglas\\x92 account is less a full explanation than a regularity. Representations of purity are only secondarily symbols of the social order.

Purity and impurity do more than judge self-identity, however. They can play a fundamental role in its performative construction; they are well adapted for smuggling assumptions into our discourses regarding the essence of particular phenomena and forms of subjectivity, simplifying a complex world into a stark contrast between the dangerous and the innocent, the valuable and the valueless, the necessary and the contingent, the originary and the prosthetic, the real and the apparent, and the unitary and the fragmented. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

       "  \"(0.718)  The Web represents a collection of socio-technical activities interoperating using a set of common protocols and standards. Online banking, web TV, internet shopping, e-government and social networking are all different kinds of human interaction that have recently leveraged the capabilities of the Web architecture. Activities that have human and computer components are referred to as social machines. This paper introduces HTP, a sociotechnical model to understand, describe and analyze the formation and development of social machines and other web activities. HTP comprises three components: heterogeneous networks of actors involved in a social machine; the iterative process of translation of the actors' activities into a temporarily stable and sustainable social machine; and the different phases of this machine's adaptation from one stable state to another as the surrounding networks restructure and global agendas ebb and flow. The HTP components are drawn from an interdisciplinary range of theoretical positions and concepts. HTP provides an analytical framework to explain why different Web activities remain stable and functional, whilst others fail. We illustrate the use of HTP by examining the formation of a classic social machine (Wikipedia), and the stabilization points corresponding to its different phases of development.\",\n",

From the perspective offered by Agamben, judgements regarding purity and impurity can be seen as in part constructing the essence against which they supposedly simply measure phenomena. Agamben's investigations suggest that on occasions when themes of purity or impurity are invoked within Western discourses on subjectivity, the full human subject tends to be placed as relatively pure: neither too close nor too distant from human essence. Following Walter Benjamin, he suggests that such a classification gives the full human subject a certain social protection and inviolability, separating relatively pure and protected human life from impure subjectivities unprotected by social or legal conventions.\",\n",

Specifically, we suggest that there is an unhelpful gulf between social scientific approaches, which offer rich theoretical and methodological understandings of the social; and computational approaches which offer sophisticated methods for data harvesting, interrogation and modelling. Brought together these approaches might meet the challenges facing social media analytics and produce a different order of understanding. We offer two preliminary examples of this synthesis in practice: first, we show how established computational tools might be harnessed to address theoretically grounded empirical questions about the social; and second we consider social theories might inspire the development of new methodological tools for social media analytics.

We characterized density and diversity of destinations that 77 older adults experienced within individually representative Global Positioning System (GPS) activity spaces and traditional residential buffers and assessed their associations with accelerometry-measured physical activity. Traditional residential buffers had lower destination density and diversity than activity spaces. Activity spaces based only on pedestrian and bicycling trips had higher destination densities than all-mode activity spaces. Regardless of neighborhood definition, adjusted associations between destinations and physical activity generally failed to reach statistical significance. However, within pedestrian and bicycling-based activity spaces, each additional destination type was associated with 243.3 more steps/day (95% confidence interval (CI) [36.0, 450.7]). Traditional buffers may not accurately portray the geographic space or neighborhood resources experienced by older adults.

       "  '(0.746)  This chapter reviews the mechanisms by which bone adapts to physical activity and the imaging modalities that have been used to quantify these changes. From this foundation, it critically reviews the influence of physical activity on bone mass accrual in boys. It then discusses the emerging data describing material and structural properties that underpin the bone strength response to physical activity. The chapter closes with a discussion of whether benefits of physical activity undertaken during the growing years are sustained across the lifespan. Effective weight-bearing physical activity can be attained through a wide range of extra-curricular sports and activities and through targeted school-based programs. It is more difficult to pinpoint the \"window of opportunity\" when the growing skeleton is most responsive to exercise-induced loads. Although pre- and early puberty may well be the most opportune times to maximize the positive impact of physical activity on the growing skeleton, the timing may vary by site. For example, boys\\' bone strength is enhanced through exercise at the clinically relevant femoral neck (through periosteal apposition) during early puberty, whereas structural adaptations at the tibia are evident in prepuberty. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

       "  '(0.674)  Background: The physical environment can facilitate or hinder physical activity. A challenge in promoting physical activity is ensuring that the physical environment is supportive and that these supports are appropriately tailored to the individual or group in question. Ideally, aspects of the environment that impact physical activity would be enhanced, but environmental changes take time, and identifying ways to provide more precision to physical activity recommendations might be helpful for specific individuals or groups. Therefore, moving beyond a \\x93one size fits all\\x94 to a precision-based approach is critical. Main body: To this end, we considered 4 critical aspects of the physical environment that influence physical activity (walkability, green space, traffic-related air pollution, and heat) and how these aspects could enhance our ability to precisely guide physical activity. Strategies to increase physical activity could include optimizing design of the built environment or mitigating of some of the environmental impediments to activity through personalized or population-wide interventions. Conclusions: Although at present non-personalized approaches may be more widespread than those tailored to one person\\x92s physical environment, targeting intrinsic personal elements (e.g., medical conditions, sex, age, socioeconomic status) has interesting potential to enhance the likelihood and ability of individuals to participate in physical activity.',\n",

A group of 123 community-dwelling older adults (Ma = ENGL = 71.83, range = 64 85, 63% women) from Canada participated in a 10-day time-sampling study. We used accelerometer-assessed physical activity, assessing negative affect three times per day and fear of falling once prior to the 10-day period. Using multilevel models, we noted considerable variability in physical activity between days (activity counts: 47%; steps: 55%).

And it examined the moderating role of physical activity intentions and functional mobility on precipitation\\x96physical activity associations. Method: One hundred and twenty-six older adults (M age = 72 years; 64% women) from Metro Vancouver provided health and background information and wore triaxial accelerometers for up to 10 consecutive days. Daily weather information was collected from local weather stations. Results: Multilevel models corroborate previous research by showing that older adults engaged in less physical activity on days with increased precipitation across four indices: activity counts, step counts, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and bout-corrected minutes of MVPA. Older adults with strong physical activity intentions engaged in more physical activity overall. Physical activity intentions also modified the association between time-varying precipitation and activity counts and step counts, whereas functional mobility moderated the negative association between precipitation and activity counts and minutes of MVPA. Discussion: Findings highlight the important role of time-varying influences on physical activity and how these associations are moderated by psychological and biological factors.'],\n",

Unfortunately, many medical schools have adopted restrictive \"organic\" technical standards based on deficits rather than on the ability to do the work. Compelling ethical considerations of justice and beneficence should prompt change in this arena. Medical schools should instead embrace \"functional\" technical standards that permit accommodations for disabilities and update their admissions policies to promote applications from qualified students with disabilities. Medical schools thus should focus on what students with disabilities can do, rather than what they cannot do, because these students further diversify the health care profession and improve our ability to care for an expanding population of patients with disabilities.',\n",

Some of the literature identifies Choosing Wisely as a shared decision-making approach. We evaluated the patient materials developed by Choosing Wisely Canada to determine whether they meet the criteria for shared decision-making tools known as patient decision aids. Design: Descriptive analysis of all Choosing Wisely Canada patient materials. Data source: In May 2015, we selected all Choosing Wisely Canada patient materials from its official website. Main outcomes and measures: Four team members independently extracted characteristics of the English materials using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) modified 16-item minimum criteria for qualifying and certifying patient decision aids. The research team discussed discrepancies between data extractors and reached a consensus. Descriptive analysis was conducted. Results: Of the 24 patient materials assessed, 12 were about treatments, 11 were about screening and 1 was about prevention. The median score for patient materials using IPDAS criteria was 10/16 (range: 8-11) for screening topics and 6/12 (range: 6-9) for prevention and treatment topics. Commonly missed criteria were stating the decision (21/24 did not), providing balanced information on option benefits/harms (24/24 did not), citing evidence (24/24 did not) and updating policy (24/24 did not). Out of 24 patient materials, only 2 met the 6 IPDAS criteria to qualify as patient decision aids, and neither of these 2 met the 6 certifying criteria. Conclusions: Patient materials developed by Choosing Wisely Canada do not meet the IPDAS minimal qualifying or certifying criteria for patient decision aids.

In the survey, 362 of 639 (57%) randomly selected consultant orthopaedic surgeons responded. Respondents appear representative of consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the UK. Of 272 valid responses, 79% (95% Cl, 73-85%) thought patient decision aids a good or excellent idea. There was consensus on the potential helpfulness of patient decision aids and core content. A booklet to take home was the preferred medium/practice model. Conclusions: Despite the increased emphasis on patient involvement in decision-making, there is little evidence in the medical literature relating to shared decision-making or the use of patient decision aids in orthopaedic surgery. Further research in this area of clinical practice is required. Our survey shows that consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the UK are generally positive about the use of patient decision aids for joint replacement surgery. Survey results could inform future development of patient decision aids for joint replacement practice in the UK.',\n",
       "  '(0.621)  Purpose: Decision-makers are looking for innovative approaches to improve patient experience and outcomes with the finite resources available in healthcare. The concept of value-based healthcare has been proposed as one such approach. Since unsafe care hinders patient experience and contributes to waste, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the value-based approach can help broaden the existing concept of patient safety culture and thus, improve patient safety and healthcare value. Design/methodology/approach: In the arguments, the authors use the triple value model which consists of personal, technical and allocative value. These three aspects together promote healthcare in which the experience of care is improved through the involvement of patients, while also considering the optimal utilisation and allocation of finite healthcare resources. Findings: While the idea that patient involvement should be integrated into patient safety culture has already been suggested, there is a lack of emphasis that economic considerations can play an important role as well. Patient safety should be perceived as an investment, thus, relevant questions need to be addressed such as how much resources should be invested into patient safety, how the finite resources should be allocated to maximise health benefits at a population level and how resources should be utilised to get the best cost-benefit ratio. Originality/value: Thus far, both the importance of patient safety culture and value-based healthcare have been advocated; this paper emphasizes the need to consider these two approaches together.',\n",

In the 1960s, Dr Cameron, a Montreal, Que, psychiatrist, experimented with drug-induced sleep and electroconvulsive therapy for psychiatric patients, believing that this method \"wipes them clean of harmful memories.\" In 1992 the government of Canada settled lawsuits by former patients of Dr Cameron, awarding them large payments. The government rejected a similar claim by Lloyd Schrier, whose mother had been treated by Dr Cameron while she was carrying Lloyd, arguing that Lloyd was not Cameron\\'s patient. Or was he? Answer. The fetus was exposed to the medications taken by his mother, (eg, barbiturates) and thus qualifies as an unconsenting patient.',\n",
       "  '(0.583)  Background Patient groups represent the interest of their members when it comes to drug funding. Many patient groups receive grants from pharmaceutical companies that make products being considered for funding. This research examines whether there is an association between the positions that Canadian groups take about the products and conflicts of interest with the companies. Methods The Common Drug Review (CDR) and panCanadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) make recommendations to Canadian provincial and federal drug plans about funding particular drug-indications. Both utilize input from patient groups in making their recommendations. Patient group submissions are available from both organizations and these submissions contain statements about conflicts of interest. Views of the patient groups, with and without a conflict with the company making the drug under consideration and without any conflicts at all, were assessed and then compared with the recommendations from CDR and pCODR. Results There was a total of 222 reports for drug-indications. There were 372 submissions from 93 different patient groups. Groups declared a total of 1896 conflicts with drug companies in 324 (87.1%) individual submissions. There were 268 submissions where groups declared a conflict with the company making the product or said they had no conflict. Irrespective of whether there was a conflict, the views of patient groups about the drug-indications under consideration were the same. There was no statistically significant difference between views of patient groups and the recommendations from CDR and/or pCODR. Conclusions The large majority of patient groups making submissions about funding of particular drug-indications had conflicts with the companies making the products and their views about the products were almost always positive. This association between funding and views needs to be further investigated to determine if a true cause and effect exists.'],\n",
       " ['(0.797)  Movie alcohol exposure is a known and consistent predictor of adolescent alcohol use initiation and escalation. Nearly 90% of the top U.S. movies contain alcohol content. Social- cognitive theory posits reciprocal links among environmental influences (e.g., movie alcohol exposure), social- cognitive processes (e.g., perceived norms, susceptibility, alcohol outcome expectancies), and behavior (alcohol use), but these links have been tested in only 1 direction. In the current study, we assessed movie alcohol exposure, alcohol cognitions, and alcohol initiation among adolescents (N = 1,023; 52% female, mean age = 13.7 years) in 4 annual survey waves. Cross-lagged panel models tested bidirectional relations between cognitions and movie alcohol exposure. Finally, we tested bidirectional mediation effects in the prospective prediction of alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure prospectively predicted increases in descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and susceptibility but not positive or negative alcohol outcome expectancies. All factors predicted subsequent alcohol initiation. Close friend injunctive and descriptive norms, peer descriptive norms, and susceptibility mediated the effect of earlier movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure mediated the effect of earlier close friend descriptive norms on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure and social-cognitive processes are interrelated facets that impact alcohol initiation. Permissive cognitions infrequently predicted higher subsequent exposure to movie alcohol. Clinical and preventative implications of this work are discussed.',\n",
       "  '(0.782)  Animal models of substance abuse have established a role for the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC) in drug taking behaviour for several addictive substances, yet nothing has thus far been reported for alcohol. The current research was undertaken to examine the involvement of the CGIC in a rat model of alcohol self-administration. We investigated the inactivating effects of local infusions of a <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid agonist mixture (baclofen/muscimol) into the CGIC on alcohol self-administration under a fixed ratio-3 (FR-3). This inactivation of the CGIC decreased operant responding for alcohol along with a corresponding decrease in oral alcohol intake. Our results demonstrate the involvement of the CGIC in alcohol taking behaviour and suggest future studies examine the differential involvement of the various subregions of the insular cortex in various aspects of alcohol consumption.',\n",
       "  '(0.762)  Objectives. To examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol availability before and after deregulation in 2015 of the alcohol market in Ontario, Canada. Methods. We quantified alcohol access by number of alcohol outlets and hours of retail for all 19 964 neighborhoods in Ontario. We used mixed effects regression models to examine the associations between alcohol access and a validated SES index between 2013 and 2017. Results. Following deregulation, the number of alcohol outlets in Ontario increased by 15.0%. Low neighborhood SES was positively associated with increased alcohol access: lower-SES neighborhoods had more alcohol outlets within 1000 meters and were closer to the nearest alcohol outlets. Outlets located in low-SES neighborhoods kept longer hours of operation. Conclusions. We observed a substantial increase in alcohol access in Ontario following deregulation. Access to alcohol was greatest in low-SES neighborhoods and may contribute to established inequities in alcohol harms. Public Health Implications. Placing limits on number of alcohol outlets and the hours of operation in low-SES neighborhoods offers an opportunity to reduce alcohol-related health inequities.',\n",

Although brand recognition is an independent, potent risk factor for alcohol outcomes among adolescents, alcohol brand appearances in popular music have not been assessed systematically. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and contextual elements associated with alcohol brand appearances in US popular music. Design Qualitative content analysis. Setting We used Billboard Magazine to identify songs to which US adolescents were most exposed in 2005-07. For each of the 793 songs, two trained coders analyzed independently the lyrics of each song for references to alcohol and alcohol brand appearances. Subsequent in-depth assessments utilized Atlas.ti to determine contextual factors associated with each of the alcohol brand appearances. Measurements Our final code book contained 27 relevant codes representing six categories: alcohol types, consequences, emotional states, activities, status and objects. Findings Average inter-rater reliability was high (<U+03BA>=0.80), and all differences were easily adjudicated. Of the 793 songs in our sample, 169 (21.3%) referred explicitly to alcohol, and of those, 41 (24.3%) contained an alcohol brand appearance. Consequences associated with alcohol were more often positive than negative (41.5% versus 17.1%, P<0.001). Alcohol brand appearances were associated commonly with wealth (63.4%), sex (58.5%), luxury objects (51.2%), partying (48.8%), other drugs (43.9%) and vehicles (39.0%). Conclusions One in five songs sampled from US popular music had explicit references to alcohol, and one-quarter of these mentioned a specific alcohol brand. These alcohol brand appearances are associated commonly with a luxury life-style characterized by wealth, sex, partying and other drugs. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.',\n",
       "  \"(0.679)  Aims: To assess the immediate effect of alcohol promoting and alcohol warning advertisements on implicit and explicit attitudes towards alcohol and on alcohol seeking behaviour. Methods: We conducted a between-participants online experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to view one of three sets of advertisements: (a) alcohol promoting, (b) alcohol warning, or (c) unrelated to alcohol. A total of 373 participants (59.5% female) aged 18-40 (M= 28.03) living in the UK were recruited online through a research agency. Positive and negative implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes towards alcohol were assessed before and after advertisements were viewed. Alcohol seeking behaviourwas measured by participants' choice of either an alcohol-related or non-alcohol-related voucher offered ostensibly as a reward for participation. Self-reported past week alcohol consumption was also recorded. Results: There were no main effects on any of the outcome measures. In heavier drinkers, viewing alcohol promoting advertisements increased positive implicit attitudes (standardized beta = 0.15, P = 0.04) and decreased negative implicit attitudes (standardized beta = -0.17, P = 0.02). In heavier drinkers, viewing alcohol warning advertisements decreased negative implicit attitudes (standardized beta = -0.19, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Viewing alcohol promoting advertisements has a cognitive impact on heavier drinkers, increasing positive and reducing negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol. Viewing alcohol warning advertisements reduces negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol in heavier drinkers, suggestive of a reactance effect.\"],\n",
       " [\"(0.801)  Purpose: Neural invasion (NI) is a histopathologic feature of colon cancer that receives little consideration. Therefore, we conducted a morphologic and functional characterization of NI in colon cancer. Experimental Design: NI was investigated in 673 patients with colon cancer. Localization and severity of NI was determined and related to patient's prognosis and survival. The neuro-affinity of colon cancer cells (HT29, HCT-116, SW620, and DLD-1) was compared with pancreatic cancer (T3M4 and SU86.86) and rectal cancer cells (CMT-93) in the in vitro three-dimensional (3D)-neural-migration assay and analyzed via live-cell imaging. Immunoreactivity of the neuroplasticity marker GAP-43, and the neurotrophic-chemoattractant factors Artemin and nerve growth factor (NGF), was quantified in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer nerves. Dorsal root ganglia of newborn rats were exposed to supernatants of colon cancer, rectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer cells and neurite density was determined. Results: NI was detected in 210 of 673 patients (31.2%). Although increasing NI severity scores were associated with a significantly poorer survival, presence of NI was not an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer. In the 3D migration assay, colon cancer and rectal cancer cells showed much less neurite-targeted migration when compared with pancreatic cancer cells. Supernatants of pancreatic cancer and rectal cancer cells induced a much higher neurite density than those of colon cancer cells. Accordingly, NGF, Artemin, and GAP-43 were much more pronounced in nerves in pancreatic cancer than in colon cancer. Conclusion: NI is not an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer. The lack of a considerable biologic affinity between colon cancer cells and neurons, the low expression profile of colonic nerves for chemoattractant molecules, and the absence of a major neuroplasticity in colon cancer may explain the low prevalence and impact of NI in colon cancer. ©2012 AACR.\",\n",
       "  '(0.603)  Glycolysis has been one of the major hallmarks of cancer, as cancer cells exhibit a high rate of glucose consumption beyond that required for energy production. Glucose acts as a substrate to generate biomass and regulates cell signaling that is required for the cancer progression. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) have been majorly playing their role in glucose transport across the cell membrane to meet their metabolic demands. Overexpression of GLUTs has been reported in various cancer types. Also, activation of certain oncogenes such as c-myc, ras, and src and several other transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1a induces the overexpression of GLUTs in cancer cells. GLUT regulation has been studied on the epigenetic level as well to provide fundamental information on its regulation. Targeting and understanding GLUTs function in cancer cells could pave novel path for therapeutic strategies against cancer.',\n",

Mutation status, sex, age and histories of cancer from their 1,903 first- and 3,255 second-degree relatives were analyzed using modified segregation analysis conditioned on the ascertainment criteria. Compared with incidences for the general population, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: urinary bladder cancer 19 (3.7\\x9697) and ovarian cancer 17 (2.4\\x96115). The HRs (95% CI) for monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: gastric cancer 9.3 (6.7\\x9613); hepatobiliary cancer 4.5 (2.7\\x967.5); endometrial cancer 2.1 (1.1\\x963.9) and breast cancer 1.4 (1.0\\x962.0). There was no evidence for an increased risk of cancers at the other sites examined (brain, pancreas, kidney or prostate). Based on the USA population incidences, the estimated cumulative risks (95% CI) to age 70 years for biallelic mutation carriers were: bladder cancer 25% (5\\x9677%) for males and 8% (2\\x9633%) for females and ovarian cancer 14% (2\\x9665%).

       "  '(0.591)  Background Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Previous studies have shown that MMR gene mutation carriers are at increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and several other cancers following an initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We estimated cancer risks following an endometrial cancer diagnosis for women carrying MMR gene mutations. Methods We obtained data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry for a cohort of 127 women who had a diagnosis of endometrial cancer and who carried a mutation in one of four MMR genes (30 carried a mutation in MLH1, 72 in MSH2, 22 in MSH6, and 3 in PMS2). We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate 10- and 20-year cumulative risks for each cancer. We estimated the age-, country-, and calendar period-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each cancer, compared with the general population. Results Following endometrial cancer, women carrying MMR gene mutations had the following 20-year risks of other cancer cancers: colorectal cancer (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 62%); cancer of the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter (11%, 95% CI = 3% to 20%); urinary bladder cancer (9%, 95% CI = 2% to 17%); and breast cancer (11%, 95% CI = 4% to 19%). Compared with the general population, these women were at statistically significantly elevated risks of colorectal cancer (SIR = 39.9, 95% CI = 27.2 to 58.3), cancer of the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter (SIR = 28.3, 95% CI = 11.9 to 48.6), urinary bladder cancer (SIR = 24.3, 95% CI = 8.56 to 42.9), and breast cancer (SIR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.17 to 4.14).

Subjects: A total of 932 overweight and obese subjects of both genders were included at eight European centers, and underwent an 8-week LCD period. Results: The weight loss at week 8 was positively correlated with initial body weight (Spearman's =<U+03C1>0.62), height (=<U+03C1>0.43), body mass index (=<U+03C1>0.43), waist (=<U+03C1>0.48) and hip circumference (=<U+03C1>0.33), sagittal diameter (=<U+03C1>0.45), fat mass (=<U+03C1>0.35) and fat-free mass (=<U+03C1>0.52), and gender (=<U+03C1>-0.36) (all <P0.01). In the multivariate regression model, adjusted for center, only initial body weight, early weight loss (week 1) and weight loss at week 3 were significant predictors of weight loss outcome at week 8: weight loss (kg) at week 80.090.046 × baseline body weight (kg)-0.311 × weight loss (kg) at week 1+1.284 × weight loss (kg) at week 3 (R2 68%, P<0.0001). A weight loss of 2.6 kg at week 1 during the LCD period was identified as the optimal cut-off predictor for at least 10 kg weight loss at week 8. Conclusions: This study suggests that initial body weight, early weight loss (week 1) and weight loss at week 3 are predictors of final weight loss during an 8-week LCD, and may be used as early biomarkers of subsequent responses to an LCD diet. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.\",\n",
       "  '(0.585)  Objective Weight loss helps reduce the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the obese, but weight regain after active weight loss is common. The changes and predictive role of circulating adipokines and sex hormones for weight regain in men during dietary intervention, and also the effect of basal MetS status on weight regain, were investigated. Design and Methods Twenty-four men who continued to lose weight (WL) and 24 men who regained weight (WR) during the 6-month follow-up period after weight loss were selected from the Diogenes Study. Their circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), luteinizing hormone, prolactin, progesterone, total and free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at baseline, after 8-week low-calorie diet-induced active weight loss, and after a subsequent 26-week ad libitum weight maintenance diet, and analyzed together with anthropometrical and physiological parameters. Results Overweight and obese men with MetS at baseline had higher risk to regain weight (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.015). High baseline RBP4, low total testosterone, and low SHBG are predictors of weight loss regain (different between WR and WL with P = 0.001, 0.038, and 0.044, respectively). Conclusions These variables may play roles in the link between MetS and weight loss regain. Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.',\n",

When this weight loss is unrecognised, opportunities for timely diagnosis of significant conditions may be missed. Objective To use electronic health record (EHR) data to estimate the frequency of unrecognised involuntary weight loss and its implications. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the weights recorded in an EHR of 100,000 adult patients seen in outpatient clinics over a 5-year period using a novel data visualisation and review tool. We reviewed charts of a random sample of 170 patients experiencing weight loss periods. Our outcomes included 1) determination of whether weight loss was voluntary versus involuntary; 2) determination of whether weight loss was recognised and documented and 3) possible explanations identifiable at the index visit or within the subsequent 2 years. Results Of 170 randomly selected weight loss periods reviewed, 22 (13%) were involuntary, 36 (21%) were voluntary and 112 (66%) were indeterminate. Sixty- six (39%) weight loss periods were recognised by clinicians at the index visits and an additional 3 (1%) at the next PCP visits. Possible explanations for weight loss emerged in the subsequent 2 years including medical conditions in 60 (45%), psychosocial conditions in 19 (14%), erroneous data entry in 9 (7%), voluntary weight loss in 8 (6%) and postpartum weight loss in 6 (4%). No possible explanations were found in 32 (24%). Conclusions Periods of weight loss were common, often involuntary and frequently not recognised or documented. Many patients with involuntary weight loss had potential explanations that emerged within the subsequent 2 years.',\n",

Identifying predictors of longer-term success will help target clinical resources more effectively. To date, focus has been predominantly on the identification of predictors of weight loss. The goal of the current study was to determine if changes in anthropometric and clinical parameters during acute weight loss are associated with subsequent weight regain. Methodology: The study consisted of an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) followed by a 6-month weight maintenance phase. Anthropometric and clinical parameters were analyzed before and after the LCD in the 285 participants (112 men, 173 women) who regained weight during the weight maintenance phase. Mixed model ANOVA, Spearman correlation, and linear regression were used to study the relationships between clinical measurements and weight regain. Principal Findings: Gender differences were observed for body weight and several clinical parameters at both baseline and during the LCD-induced weight loss phase. LCD-induced changes in BMI (Spearman's <U+03C1> = 0.22, p = 0.0002) were inversely associated with weight regain in both men and women. LCD-induced changes in fasting insulin (<U+03C1> = 0.18, p = 0.0043) and HOMA-IR (<U+03C1> = 0.19, p = 0.0023) were also associated independently with weight regain in both genders. The aforementioned associations remained statistically significant in regression models taking account of variables known to independently influence body weight.

       "  '(0.566)  Background: The scale of overweight and obesity in the UK places a considerable burden on the NHS. In some areas the NHS has formed partnerships with commercial companies to offer weight management services, but there has been little evaluation of these schemes. This study is an independent audit of the Weight Watchers NHS Referral scheme and evaluates the weight change of obese and overweight adults referred to Weight Watchers (WW) by the NHS. Method. Data was obtained from the WW NHS Referral Scheme database for 29,326 referral courses started after 2nd April 2007 and ending before 6th October 2009 [90% female; median age 49 years (IQR 38 - 61 years); median BMI 35.1 kg/m2 (IQR 31.8 - 39.5 kg/m2). Participants received vouchers (funded by the PCT following referral by a healthcare professional) to attend 12 WW meetings. Body weight was measured at WW meetings and relayed to the central database. Results: Median weight change for all referrals was -2.8 kg [IQR -5.9 - -0.7 kg] representing -3.1% initial weight. 33% of all courses resulted in loss of 5% initial weight. 54% of courses were completed. Median weight change for those completing a first course was -5.4 kg [IQR -7.8 - -3.1 kg] or -5.6% of initial weight. 57% lost 5% initial weight. Conclusions: A third of all patients who were referred to WW through the WW NHS Referral Scheme and started a 12 session course achieved 5% weight loss, which is usually associated with clinical benefits. This is the largest audit of NHS referral to a commercial weight loss programme in the UK and results are comparable with other options for weight loss available through primary care. © 2011 Ahern et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'],\n",

       "  \"(0.552)  Background: Ethics and quality care are common drivers for healthcare organisations. Both are based on ethics principles that are the foundation for quality, and are synergistic with the Institute of Medicine's six quality aims. This paper describes the relationship between ethics principles and the goals of improving quality, safety and value. It demonstrates how healthcare staff, quality improvement professionals and ethics committee members could apply a quality improvement framework to address and prevent ethics issues. Discussion Recurring ethics issues can have a detrimental impact on both the quality of patient care and the culture of a healthcare organisation. Clinical staff and ethics committee members traditionally respond to ethics issues using a reactive approach. Despite nascent interest in a system-oriented preventive approach to ethics issues, there is limited practical advice for ethics committee members regarding how to specifically implement a system redesign strategy. Using an illustrative case study, the authors demonstrate how to apply a recognised quality improvement framework, which focuses on clinical microsystems, to manage and decrease ethics issuesdtherefore enhancing the organisation's quality of care. Conclusion: An important step in enhancing quality and ethics aims would be for the organisation's staff, including quality improvement professionals and ethics committee members, to collaborate in fostering system redesign. The authors' aim is not to examine in detail a specific quality improvement approach or method; rather, they wish to highlight the synergy they believe exists between quality improvement efforts and organisational ethics issues.\",\n",
       "  '(0.548)  The issue of \\x91quality\\x92 in qualitative research is part of a much larger and contested debate about the nature of the knowledge produced by qualitative research, whether its quality can legitimately be judged according to a single set of general principles and, if so, how. In the field of qualitative research, concern to be able to assess quality has manifested itself in the proliferation of guidelines for doing and judging qualitative work, particularly in the health field. This chapter outlines two views of how qualitative methods might be judged. It then argues that qualitative research can be assessed with reference to the same broad criteria of quality as quantitative research, albeit the meaning attributed to these criteria may not be exactly the same and they may be assessed differently. The chapter concludes with a list of questions that can be used as a guide to assessing the quality of a piece of qualitative research.',\n",
       "  '(0.5)  This paper reviews and critiques the different approaches to the use of narrative in quality improvement research. The defining characteristics of narrative are chronology (unfolding over time); emplotment (the literary juxtaposing of actions and events in an implicitly causal sequence); trouble (that is, harm or the risk of harm); and embeddedness (the personal story nests within a particular social, historical and organisational context). Stories are about purposeful action unfolding in the face of trouble and, as such, have much to offer quality improvement researchers. But the quality improvement report (a story about efforts to implement change), which is common, must be distinguished carefully from narrative based quality improvement research (focused systematic enquiry that uses narrative methods to generate new knowledge), which is currently none. We distinguish four approaches to the use of narrative in quality improvement research - narrative interview; naturalistic story gathering; organisational case study; and collective sense-making-and offer a rationale, describe how data can be collected and analysed, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each using examples from the quality improvement literature. Narrative research raises epistemological questions about the nature of narrative truth (characterised by sense-making and emotional impact rather than scientific objectivity), which has implications for how rigour should be defined (and how it might be achieved) in this type of research. We offer some provisional guidance for distinguishing high quality narrative research in a quality improvement setting from other forms of narrative account such as report, anecdote, and journalism.',\n",

       " [\"(0.607)  The objective of this study was to determine whether patients with Crohn's disease (CD) value the absolute reduction in postoperative recurrence risk attributable to therapy with mesalamine (5-ASA). One hundred subjects evaluated state A (taking 5-ASA; 25% risk of recurrence), state B (not taking 5-ASA; 40% risk of recurrence), and state C (100% risk of recurrence) by rank order, visual analog scale (VAS), and standard gamble (SG). Sixty-five of 91 patients (71%) with completed and usable questionnaires had the same preference order for state A (25% risk), state B (40% risk), and state C (100% risk) on both the VAS and the SG. The mean scores for state A (25% risk), state B (40% risk), and state C (100% risk), respectively, were 67.5, 49.8, and 19.8 on the VAS and 0.977, 0.972, and 0.910 on the SG. Subgroup analyses using stepwise logistic regression showed that risk attitude seemed to be predictive of subjects' preferences for 5-ASA. These results suggest that most subjects seem to value the 15% absolute risk reduction offered by 5-ASA. Furthermore, the SG seems to be a feasible method for measuring utilities for uncertain health states in patients with CD.\",\n",
       "  '(0.56)  Objective: To synthesize the literature on the effect of provision of personalised cancer risk information to individuals at population level risk on accuracy of risk perception and psychological responses. Methods: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of articles published from 01/01/2000 to 01/07/2017. Results: We included 23 studies. Immediately after provision of risk information 87% of individuals were able to recall the absolute risk estimate. Less than half believed that to be their risk, with up to 71% believing their risk to be higher than the estimate. Provision of risk information increased accuracy of perceived absolute risk immediately after risk information compared with no information (pooled RR 4.16 (95%CI 1.28\\x9613.49), 3 studies). There was no significant effect on comparative risk accuracy (pooled RR 1.39 (0.72\\x962.69), 2 studies) and either no change or a reduction in cancer worry, anxiety and fear. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complex cognitive processes involved in the conceptualisation of risk. Practice implications: Individuals who appear to understand and are able to recall risk information most likely do not believe it reflects their own risk.',\n",
       "  \"(0.556)  Individuals frequently have difficulty understanding how behavior can reduce genetically-conferred risk for diseases such as colon cancer. With increasing opportunities to purchase genetic tests, communication strategies are needed for presenting information in ways that optimize comprehension and adaptive behavior. Using the Common-Sense Model, we tested the efficacy of a strategy for providing information about the relationships (links) among the physiological processes underlying disease risk and protective action on understanding, protective action motivations, and willingness to purchase tests. We tested the generalizability of the strategy's effects across varying risk levels, for genetic tests versus tests of a nongenetic biomarker, and when using graphic and numeric risk formats. In an internet-based experiment, 749 adults from four countries responded to messages about a hypothetical test for colon cancer risk. Messages varied by Risk-Action Link Information (provision or no provision of information describing how a low-fat diet reduces risk given positive results, indicating presence of a gene fault), Risk Increment (20%, 50%, or 80% risk given positive results), Risk Format (numeric or graphic presentation of risk increments), and Test Type (genetic or enzyme). Providing risk-action link information enhanced beliefs of coherence (understanding how a low-fat diet reduces risk) and response efficacy (low-fat diets effectively reduce risk) and lowered appraisals of anticipated risk of colon cancer given positive results. These effects held across risk increments, risk formats, and test types. For genetic tests, provision of risk-action link information reduced the amount individuals were willing to pay for testing. Brief messages explaining how action can reduce genetic and biomarker-detected risks can promote beliefs motivating protective action. By enhancing understanding of behavioral control, they may reduce the perceived value of genetic risk information. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.507)  Purpose of review The article discusses recent approaches in the literature about clients who chose to live at risk in their homes. It argues for a positive risk-based approach and a tool to help manage risk in the home, and applies these to a hypothetical end-of-life scenario. Recent findings Historically, safety plans to consider risk management involved a culture of risk aversion supported by sometimes paternalistic motives intended to protect vulnerable clients. New findings in the literature engage in a process that respects the ethical principles underlying harm reduction philosophies. The literature also argues for a perspective that moves away from viewing risk as only harmful, to one that supports a positive understanding of risk as part of a client's informed choice. Summary A risk support management plan, based on a positive approach, can provide a way to both support a client's choice to live at risk, anticipate for expected complications, and inform the creation of a contingency plan to address concerns as they may arise. The added value of a structured approach like the one proposed here for risk support management plans is that it provides adequate due diligence and informed decision-making when planning for risk-taking in complex situations.\",\n",
       "  '(0.507)  Background: Framingham risk equations are widely used to predict cardiovascular disease based on health information from a single time point. Little is known regarding use of information from repeat risk assessments and temporal change in estimated cardiovascular risk for prediction of future cardiovascular events. This study was aimed to compare the discrimination and risk reclassification of approaches using estimated cardiovascular risk at single and repeat risk assessments Methods: Using data on 12,197 individuals enrolled in EPIC-Norfolk cohort, with 12 years of follow-up, we examined rates of cardiovascular events by levels of estimated absolute risk (Framingham risk score) at the first and second health examination four years later. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC) and risk reclassification, comparing approaches using information from single and repeat risk assessments (i.e., estimated risk at different time points). Results: The mean Framingham risk score increased from 15.5% to 17.5% over a mean of 3.7 years from the first to second health examination. Individuals with high estimated risk (=20%) at both health examinations had considerably higher rates of cardiovascular events than those who remained in the lowest risk category (<10%) in both health examinations (34.0 [95%CI 31.7-36.6] and 2.7 [2.2-3.3] per 1,000 person-years respectively). Using information from the most up-to-date risk assessment resulted in a small non-significant change in risk classification over the previous risk assessment (net reclassification improvement of -4.8%, p>0.05). Using information from both risk assessments slightly improved discrimination compared to information from a single risk assessment (aROC 0.76 and 0.75 respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions: Using information from repeat risk assessments over a period of four years modestly improved prediction, compared to using data from a single risk assessment. However, this approach did not improve risk classification.'],\n",
       " ['(0.745)  Retrospective data harmonization across multiple research cohorts and studies is frequently done to increase statistical power, provide comparison analysis, and create a richer data source for data mining. However, when combining disparate data sources, harmonization projects face data management and analysis challenges. These include differences in the data dictionaries and variable definitions, privacy concerns surrounding health data representing sensitive populations, and lack of properly defined data models. With the availability of mature open-source web-based database technologies, developing a complete software architecture to overcome the challenges associated with the harmonization process can alleviate many roadblocks. By leveraging state-of-the-art software engineering and database principles, we can ensure data quality and enable cross-center online access and collaboration.This paper outlines a complete software architecture developed and customized using the Django web framework, leveraged to harmonize sensitive data collected from three NIH-support birth cohorts. We describe our framework and show how we successfully overcame challenges faced when harmonizing data from these cohorts.

Literature review and shared experiential learning from research using routinely collected data. We excluded socio-cultural issues, and privacy and security issues as our focus was to explore linking clinical data. Six key concepts describe data: (1) Data quality: the core Overarching concept - Are these data fit for purpose? (2) Data provenance: defined as how data came to be; incorporating the concepts of lineage and pedigree. Mapping this process requires metadata. New variables derived during data analysis have their own provenance. (3) Data extraction errors and (4) Data processing errors, which are the responsibility of the investigator extracting the data but need quantifying. (5) Traceability: the capability to identify the origins of any data cell within the final analysis table essential for good governance, and almost impossible without a formal system of metadata; and (6) Curation: storing data and look-up tables in a way that allows future researchers to carry out further research or review earlier findings. There are common distinct steps in processing data; the quality of any metadata may be predictive of the quality of the process. Outputs based on routine data should include a review of the process from data origin to curation and publish information about their data provenance and processing method.',\n",
       "  '(0.633)  Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.',\n",

       "  '(0.513)  Managed Care in the U.S. is one of the more controversial strategies to implicitly ration health care. It has also been creeping into Canada where care is similarly being managed albeit in a different socio-political environment. Based on nine group interviews with 35 RNs in California and 10 group interviews with 39 RNs in British Columbia, we find that the price to be paid for the promise of cheaper, more efficient health care through managerial strategies is borne largely by nurses and other health care providers. The data reveal that nurses in British Columbia and California share similar experiences with how the amount of care is rationed at the bedside - through care pathways, early discharge policies and reduced staffing - while the rationing of access to care differs because of the socio-political contexts of their respective health care systems. In both cases, the implicit rationing of care through managerial strategies fails to deliver on its promises.',\n",

We produce projections of state and private long-term care expenditure and analyse the distributional impact of state-financed care, through innovative linking of macro- and micro-simulation models. Variant assumptions about life expectancy, dependency and care costs are examined and the impact of universal state-financed ('free') personal care, based on need but not ability to pay, is investigated. We find that future long-term-care expenditure is subject to considerable uncertainty and is particularly sensitive to assumed future trends in real input costs. On a central set of assumptions, free personal' care would, by 2051, increase public spending on long-term care from 1.1 per cent of GDP to 1.3 per cent, or more if it generated an increase in demand. Among the care-home population aged 85 or over, the immediate beneficiaries of free personal care would be those with relatively high incomes.\",\n",

       "  '(0.618)  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Family medicine is continuously advanced by a reinforcing research enterprise. In the United States, each national family medicine organization contributes to the discipline\\x92s research foundations. We sought to map the unique and interorganizational roles of the eight US family medicine professional organizations participating in Family Medicine for America\\x92s Health (FMAHealth) in supporting family medicine research. METHODS: We interviewed leaders and reviewed supporting materials from organizations participating in FMAHealth. We explored existing activities, capacity, and collaboration. We identified areas of strength and opportunities for growth and synergy with respect to how the family of family medicine nurtures family medicine research. RESULTS: The FMAHealth organizations support certain aspects of the family medicine research infrastructure. Six domains were identified through this work: showcasing scholarship, communication and dissemination, workforce development, data-driven initiatives, performing primary research, and advocacy for family medicine research. Each organization\\x92s areas of emphasis differ, but we found substantial collaboration on initiatives across organizations, possibly attributable to the fact that many members belong to more than one organization. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberate contributions to each of the six domains identified herein will be important for the future success of family medicine research. Key opportunity areas described here include coordinated and strategic advocacy for increased funding for family medicine research, dedicated investment in training opportunities, protected effort to grow the next generation of family medicine researchers, pilot funding to build a research base for future high-impact research, and infrastructure to facilitate cross-institutional collaboration and data sharing.',\n",

To assess the state of family medicine research in the United States, this study identifies and describes research articles published by family medicine researchers from the United States in 2003 and assesses the growth in articles, authors, and publishing journals since 2000. Methods: We searched for all research articles published in 2003 in scholarly, English-language journals authored by individuals in US family medicine organizations and by family physicians from the United States. Search approaches included a hard copy review of 22 journals and Medline searches of articles by family medicine authors and organizations. Similar search approaches, previously reported, were used to identify articles published in 2000. Results: For 2003 we found 790 research articles dispersed across 285 journals from 801 family medicine researcher-authors. Twenty-nine journals published 6 or more family medicine research articles; 159 journals published just 1 research article from the discipline. Family medicine journals published 18% of the discipline's research articles. People in academic departments authored the vast majority (89%) of the discipline's research. Between 2000 and 2003 family medicine's research articles increased by an estimated 58%, its authors increased by 41%, and journals used increased by 82%.

Focus group discussions were conducted with 141 adolescents from 7th and 10th grade health education classes from urban public junior and senior high schools in Minnesota. Twenty-one focus groups were audio-taped, tapes were transcribed verbatim, transcripts were reviewed for emerging themes, and themes were coded using content analysis procedures. For some adolescents, family meals were part of their daily routine, whereas for others, family meals were not the norm. Diversity also existed with regard to the context of family meals, such as activities during meals and settings for meals. Major reasons for not having meals as a family included parent and teen schedules, teen desire for autonomy, dissatisfaction with family relations, and dislike of food served at family meals. Most of the adolescents thought that they would eat more healthful foods it they ate more often with their families. Key factors that appeared to influence whether participation in family meals would lead to a more healthful diet included food availability at meals, rules around mealtimes, and health-related attitudes of family members. There is great diversity in both the quantity and quality of meals in the families of adolescents. Health care providers working with youth and their families should inquire about family meals and encourage the practice of eating with family members, taking into account what is feasible for a particular family.\",\n",

Composition of the committee Since 2012, the College of Family Physicians of Canada has hosted the Besrour Conferences to reflect on its role in advancing the discipline of family medicine globally. The Besrour Narrative Working Group was conceived in 2012 at the first Besrour Conference. Their mandate was to use narrative and appreciative inquiry to gather stories of family medicine worldwide. The working group comprised members of various academic departments of family medicine in Canada and abroad who attended the conferences. Methods A consultation process with our partners from lower-middle-income countries was undertaken from 2012 to 2014. Stories were sought from each global partner institute with ties to Canadian family medicine departments. An appreciative inquiry approach was chosen to elicit narratives. Thematic analysis was used to search for common threads and important elements of success that could serve to inform other initiatives in other nations and, in turn, offer hope for greater effect. Report Sixteen narrative stories have been collected so far. These stories highlight insightful solutions, foresight, perseverance, and ultimately a steadfast belief that family medicine will improve the health system and the care provided to the citizens of each nation. Seventeen themes were elucidated by 3 independent Canadian readers. At a subsequent workshop, these themes were validated by Besrour Centre members from Canada and elsewhere. The linkage between the thematic analysis and the experiences of various schools helps to illustrate both the robustness and the usefulness of the narratives in exploring generalizable observations and the features supporting success in each institute. Conclusion If we are to understand, and contribute to, the development of family medicine throughout the world (a key objective of the Besrour Centre), we must begin to hear each others' stories and search for ways in which our collective story can advance the discipline.\"],\n",

Objective: To assess safety reporting in pre-eclampsia trials. Search strategy: Systematic search using bibliographic databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and MEDLINE, from inception to August 2017. Selection criteria: Randomised trials evaluating anticonvulsant or antihypertensive medication for pre-eclampsia. Data collection and analysis: Descriptive statistics appraising the adequacy of adverse reaction and toxicity reporting. Main results: We included 60 randomised trials. Six trials (10%) were registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, two registry records referred to adverse reactions, stating \\x91safety and toleration\\x92 and \\x91possible side effects\\x92 would be collected. Twenty-six trials (43%) stated the frequency of withdrawals within each study arm, and five trials (8%) adequately reported these withdrawals. Adverse reactions were inconsistently reported across eligible trials: 24 (40%) reported no serious adverse reactions and 36 (60%) reported no mild adverse reactions. The methods of definition or measurement of adverse reactions were infrequently reported within published trial reports. Conclusions: Pre-eclampsia trials regularly omit critical information related to safety. Despite the paucity of reporting, randomised trials collect an enormous amount of safety data.

There is no gold standard to measure diarrhea, making comparison across trials difficult. We conducted a systematic review to determine current research practice in measuring HIV-related diarrhea. Method: MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 2006 for clinical trials of treatment for HIV-related diarrhea. The following data were abstracted: type of trial, treatment studied, definition of diarrhea, and definition of improvement in diarrhea. Results: We reviewed 384 articles; 46 met our inclusion criteria. Forty-two trials were prospective: 25 were open-label and 17 were controlled trials. Antimicrobials were studied most often (15 trials): octreotide was studied in 10 trials, and HAART in 5. Presence of diarrhea was most often defined by duration (33 trials, 72%), stool frequency (29 trials, 63%), and/or stool form (23 trials, 50%); often, more than one parameter was used. Stool frequency was used most often to measure diarrhea improvement (28 trials, 61 %). Only one trial used a measure validated for HIV-related diarrhea.

An easy-to-use, well-accepted, and valid tool to measure HIV-related diarrhea would enhance research in this field. © 2007 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.',\n",
       "  '(0.562)  Background: We would expect information on adverse drug reactions in randomised clinical trials to be easily retrievable from specific searches of electronic databases. However, complete retrieval of such information may not be straightforward, for two reasons. First, not all clinical drug trials provide data on the frequency of adverse effects. Secondly, not all electronic records of trials include terms in the abstract or indexing fields that enable us to select those with adverse effects data. We have determined how often automated search methods, using indexing terms and/or textwords in the title or abstract, would fail to retrieve trials with adverse effects data. Methods: We used a sample set of 107 trials known to report frequencies of adverse drug effects, and measured the proportion that (i) were not assigned the appropriate adverse effects indexing terms in the electronic databases, and (ii) did not contain identifiable adverse effects textwords in the title or abstract. Results: Of the 81 trials with records on both MEDLINE and EMBASE, 25 were not indexed for adverse effects in either database. Twenty-six trials were indexed in one database but not the other. Only 66 of the 107 trials reporting adverse effects data mentioned this in the abstract or title of the paper. Simultaneous use of textword and indexing terms retrieved only 82/107 (77%) papers. Conclusions: Specific search strategies based on adverse effects textwords and indexing terms will fail to identify nearly a quarter of trials that report on the rate of drug adverse effects.',\n",

We aimed to define characteristics of drug trials that appear to be influenced by marketing considerations and estimate their prevalence. Methods: We examined reports of randomised controlled trials of drugs published in six general medical journals in 2011. Six investigators independently reviewed all publications, characterising them as YES/MAYBE/NO suspected marketing trials, and then met to reach consensus. Blinded researchers then extracted key trial characteristics. We used blinded cluster analysis to determine if key variables could characterise the categories of trials (YES/MAYBE/NO). Results: 41/194 (21 %) trials were categorised as YES, 14 (7 %) as MAYBE, 139 (72 %) as NO. All YES and MAYBE trials were funded by the manufacturer, compared with 37 % of NO trials (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of YES trials had authors or contributors from the manufacturer involved in study design (83 % vs. 19 %), data analysis (85 % vs.15 %) and reporting (81 % vs. 15 %) than NO trials (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in the median number of participants screened (p = 0.49), but the median number of centres recruiting participants was higher for YES compared with NO trials (171 vs. 13, p < 0.001). YES trials were not more likely to use a surrogate (42 % vs. 30 %; p = 0.38) or composite primary outcome measure (34 % vs. 19 %; p = 0.14) than NO trials. YES trials were often better reported in terms of blinding, safety outcomes and adverse events than NO trials. YES trials more frequently included speculation that might encourage clinicians to use the intervention outside of the study population compared to NO trials (59 % vs.37 %, p = 0.03). Cluster analysis based on study characteristics did not identify a clear variable structure that accurately characterised YES/MAYBE/NO trials. Conclusions: We reached consensus that a fifth of drug trials published in the highest impact general medical journals in 2011 had features that were suggestive of being designed for marketing purposes. Each of the marketing trials appeared to have a unique combination of features reported in the journal publications.',\n",

       " ['(0.887)  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the ability to collect blood pressure readings several times an hour across a 24-hour period. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring facilitates the identification of whitecoat hypertension, the phenomenon whereby certain individuals who are not taking antihypertensive medication show elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but show nonelevated blood pressure averages when assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In addition, readings can be segmented into time windows of particular interest, for example, mean daytime and nighttime values. During sleep, blood pressure typically decreases, or dips, such that mean sleep blood pressure is lower than mean awake blood pressure. A nondipping pattern and nocturnal hypertension are strongly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 70% of individuals have blood pressure dips of =10% at night, whereas 30% have nondipping patterns, when blood pressure remains similar to daytime average or occasionally increases above daytime average.

Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7\\x96128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0\\x96123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9\\x9679·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·9\\x9677·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% (21·4\\x9627·1) in men and 20·1% (17·8\\x9622·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

       "  '(0.824)  OBJECTIVE: We tested the accuracy of the HEM-780REL automatic blood pressure monitor with Easy Wrap Cuff. METHODS: We used the International Protocol for validation of blood pressure measuring devices developed by the Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring of the European Society of Hypertension. Thirty-three adults over the age of 30 years participated to have 11 total participants in each of the three required blood pressure ranges for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Sequential blood pressure readings were taken independently by trained observers using a mercury standard with appropriate size cuff. A third observer performed measurements with the test device. Analyses were performed according to International Protocol specifications for the 99 pairs of measurements. The device was given a pass/fail recommendation based on bands of accuracy compared with the mercury standard (within 5, 10, or 15 mmHg), as well as number of readings per participant within 5 mmHg. RESULTS: The mean blood pressure difference was 0.52±7.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 0.39±4.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twenty-four out of 33 participants had two out of three readings within 5 mmHg of the mercury standard for systolic blood pressure. Twenty-seven out of 33 participants had two out of three readings within 5 mmHg of the mercury standard for diastolic blood pressure. The device received a passing grade both for accuracy of individual measurements and for accuracy for individuals. CONCLUSION: The HEM-780REL with Easy Wrap Cuff performs accurately according to the standards of the International Protocol. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.',\n",
       "  '(0.819)  We have assessed the association between excessive orthostatic changes in blood pressure and risk of incident heart failure (HF) in older, community-dwelling men. This was a prospective cohort study of 3505 men (mean age, 68.5 years), who did not have prevalent HF, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Excessive orthostatic change in blood pressure was defined continuously and categorically as orthostatic hypotension (sitting-to-standing decrease in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), systolic orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg, diastolic orthostatic hypertension as diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), and orthostatic normotension (neither orthostatic hypotension nor orthostatic hypertension). There was a U-shaped association between orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and the risk of incident HF; for diastolic blood pressure, only its fall predicted HF. After adjustment for possible confounders, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for incident HF was 1.65 (1.24-2.18) in men with orthostatic hypotension and 0.90 (0.65-1.24) and 1.88 (1.30-2.73) in men with diastolic and systolic orthostatic hypertension, respectively. Both components of orthostatic hypotension were associated with increased risk, although the systolic component was more predictive than the diastolic component. Both orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension are associated with risk of incident HF in older men. Our findings suggest that orthostatic hypertension is defined by a rise beyond threshold in systolic blood pressure only. Further prospective studies in diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings.',\n",
       "  '(0.818)  Office blood pressure measurement has been the basis for hypertension evaluation for almost a century. However, the evaluation of blood pressure out of the office using ambulatory or self-home monitoring is now strongly recommended for the accurate diagnosis in many, if not all, cases with suspected hypertension. Moreover, there is evidence that the variability of blood pressure might offer prognostic information that is independent of the average blood pressure level. Recently, advancement in technology has provided noninvasive evaluation of central (aortic) blood pressure, which might have attributes that are additive to the conventional brachial blood pressure measurement. This position statement, developed by international experts, deals with key research and practical issues in regard to peripheral blood pressure measurement (office, home, and ambulatory), blood pressure variability, and central blood pressure measurement. The objective is to present current achievements, identify gaps in knowledge and issues concerning clinical application, and present relevant research questions and directions to investigators and manufacturers for future research and development (primary goal).'],\n",
       " ['(0.686)  In South Africa, economic liberalization and the technological innovations in the mining sector have altered employment opportunities for rural Xhosa. Young men struggle to find jobs as labor migrants, while some young women find work in villages. These women assume provider roles for their families that are reminiscent of longstanding normative masculine achievements. They also use their income to achieve relative independence. Although many households depend on working women, they nevertheless attract criticism. Women mobilize a discourse of \\x93human rights\\x94 to defend their position in these conflicts, even as men argue that \\x93human rights\\x94 enable women\\x92s wayward behaviour. Drawing on fieldwork in the Eastern Cape, this article argues that working women provoke controversy because of how they trouble gendered meanings attached to work, domesticity, and social reproduction. I show that although they challenge the patriarchal domestic order through lifestyle choices and overt appeals to the \\x93right\\x94 to remain single, the strategies that working women deploy to manage conflicting expectations and a heavy workload also reproduce patriarchal domestic hierarchies. In so doing, they further exclude young men from social reproduction.

       "  \"(0.568)  The starting place for this essay is Knupfer and Room's insight that more restrictive norms around drinking and intoxication tend to be selectively applied to the economically dependent segments of society, such as women. However, since these authors wrote in 1964, women in the US and many other societies around the globe have experienced rising economic independence. The essay considers how the moral categories of acceptable drinking and drunkenness may have shifted alongside women's rising economic independence, and looks at evidence on the potential consequences for women's health and wellbeing. I argue that, as women have gained economic independence, changes in drinking norms have produced two different kinds of negative unintended consequences for women at high and low extremes of economic spectrum. As liberated women of the middle and upper classes have become more economically equal to men, they have enjoyed the right to drink with less restraint. For them, alongside the equal right to drink has come greater equality in exposure to alcohol-attributable harms, abuse and dependence. I further suggest that, as societies become more liberated, the economic dependency of low-income women is brought into greater question. Under such conditions, women in poverty-particularly those economically dependent on the state, such as welfare mothers-have become subject to more restrictive norms around drinking and intoxication, and more punitive social controls.

Opponents of abortion use these statistics to argue that abortion providers are exploiting women of color and low socioeconomic status, and thus, regulations are needed to protect women. This argument ignores the underlying causes of the disparities. As efforts to restrict abortion will have no effect on these underlying factors, and instead will only result in more women experiencing later abortions or having an unintended childbirth, they are likely to result in worsening health disparities. We provide a review of the causes of abortion disparities and argue for a multifaceted public health approach to address them.',\n",
       "  '(0.545)  Background: It is not known if lower uptake of prenatal screening for Down syndrome in women from minority ethnic groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged women reflects more negative attitudes towards undergoing the test or women not acting in line with their attitudes i.e. not making an informed choice. Methods: Uptake of prenatal screening, attitudes towards undergoing the test, uptake-attitude consistency, and informed choice were assessed in a prospective study of 1499 pregnant women attending two UK hospitals. Results: Uptake was higher in white and socioeconomically advantaged women than in other women. There were no differences in attitudes towards undergoing the test; all women expressed relatively positive attitudes. Uptake-attitude consistency was higher in white and socioeconomically advantaged women than others, particularly in those with positive attitudes towards undergoing the test (76% white women with positive attitudes had the test compared with 45% South Asian women [difference 31%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 18-43] and 78% socioeconomically advantaged women compared with 63% more disadvantaged women (difference 15%, 95% CI 7-24)). Controlling for demographic variables, South Asian and socioeconomically disadvantaged women with positive attitudes were less likely to make an informed choice than other women [odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.45 and OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93, respectively]. Conclusion: Lower uptake of screening for Down syndrome in women from minority ethnic groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged women does not reflect more negative attitudes towards screening but rather lower rates of informed choice, as assessed in this study. Healthcare systems appear to facilitate informed choices in the context of prenatal screening for Down syndrome screening less well for women from minority ethnic groups and those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged than for other women. © The Author 2005; all rights reserved.',\n",

We describe a 1-year, retrospective, observational study to characterize pain trajectories of hospitalized adults during the first 48 hours after admission at an urban academic medical center. Using a subgroup of patients who presented with significant pain (pain score >4; n 7762 encounters), we characterized pain trajectories and measured area under the curve, slope of the trajectory for the first 2 hours after admission, and pain intensity at plateau. We used mixed-effects regression to assess the association between pain score and sociodemographics (age, race, and gender), pain medication orders (opioids, nonopioids, and no medications), and medical service (obstetrics, psychiatry, surgery, sickle cell, intensive care unit, and medicine). K-means clustering was used to identify patient subgroups with similar trajectories. Trajectories showed differences based on race, gender, service, and initial pain score. Patients presumed to have dissimilar pain experiences (eg, sickle vs obstetrical) had markedly different pain trajectories. Patients with higher initial pain had a more rapid reduction during their first 2 hours of treatment. Pain reduction achieved in the 48 hours after admission was approximately 50% of the initial pain, regardless of the initial pain. Most patients' pain failed to fully resolve, plateauing at a pain score of 4 or greater. Visualizing pain scores as graphical trajectories illustrates the dynamic variability in pain, highlighting pain responses over a period of observation, and may yield new insights for quality improvement and research.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.79)  Objectives: To examine sex differences pertaining to pain characteristics in patients presenting to the ambulatory emergency department (ED) with nontraumatic chest pain and to the prediction of exercise-induced ischemia on a follow-up electrocardiogram. Methods: This was a prospective study of 131 women and 202 men (mean age 58 years) consulting the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. Seventy-eight women and 116 men underwent exercise stress testing following the ED consultation. Chest pain location, extension, intensity and quality were measured. Chest pain was classified as nonspecific, or typical or atypical of angina. Results: Women received fewer 'typical' angina pain diagnoses (P<0.05), rated their pain as more intense (P<0.05) and used more affective words to describe their pain (P<0.05) compared with men. Pain in the posterior shoulder and middle back areas were more frequently reported by women (P<0.05). The presence of pain in the right anterior and posterior shoulder, as well as the absence of pain in the left anterior shoulder, predicted ischemia (P<0.05) in both men and women. Only in men, pain in the retrosternal and right middle back areas, as well as a classification of pain as typical or atypical, further contributed to the prediction of ischemia. Conclusions: Sex differences exist in the experience of chest pain and in the prediction of exercise-induced ischemia from pain variables. Further research on the unique symptomatology of men and women is needed to optimize their medical management.\",\n",
       "  '(0.785)  We have examined the characteristics of the pain experience as well as barriers to optimal pain management in 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) consecutively attending a specialist rheumatology practice. Pain was reported to be moderate to severe in 32 (53%) and mild to absent in 28 (47%). Sixty-five percent of all patients, including almost half of those with moderate to severe pain, reported satisfaction with current pain control. The average number of barriers to pain management for individual patients was 2.6 ± 1.5, with 33 patients (55%) reporting 3 or more barriers. Specific barriers included concern about side effects of medications in 80%, dislike for \"too many pills\" in 63%, concern about drug interactions in 57%, fear of addiction in 35%, and fear of masking disease in 27% of the patients. More barriers were significantly associated with higher pain level (r = .33, P = .011) and pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (r = .29, P = .024). Other than the regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 37% of the patients and acetaminophen in 37%, analgesics or other modalities to reduce pain were seldom used. Perspective: Moderate to severe pain was present in over half of patients with RA with many reporting the presence of considerable barriers to pain control. These barriers likely contribute to sub optimal pain management. RA patients tolerate pain and use limited mechanisms to deal with the symptom of pain. © 2009 American Pain Society.',\n",

Methods: The validity of published International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coding algorithms for identifying patients with particular chronic pain syndromes in the RAMQ database was tested using pain specialist-established diagnostic data of 561 patients enrolled in the Quebec Pain Registry, which was used as the reference standard. Modified versions of these algorithms (i.e., adaptation of the number of healthcare encounters) were also tested. For each algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results: In the RAMQ database, some previously published algorithms and modified versions of these algorithms were found to be valid for identifying patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain (sensitivity: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.59-0.71; specificity: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.79-0.87), chronic back pain (sensitivity: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.64-0.76; specificity: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.68-0.78), and chronic neck/back pain (sensitivity: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.65-0.76; specificity: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.72-0.82). Algorithms to identify patients with other types of chronic pain showed low sensitivity: complex regional pain syndrome (=0.07), fibromyalgia (=0.42), and neuropathic pain (=0.39). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence supporting the value of the RAMQ administrative database for conducting research on certain types of chronic pain disorders including back and neck pain. Users should, however, be cautious about the limitations of this database for studying other types of chronic pain syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain.\",\n",
       "  '(0.78)  Failure to appreciate how pain arises in tendinopathies may be limiting medical progress. It is assumed that tendon overuse causes inflammation, and thus pain. We critically review the inflammatory model of pain in tendinopathy and find that it does not withstand scrutiny. The generally proposed alternative model is that of mechanical discontinuity of collagen fibers, but this as well is inconsistent with numerous surgical observations. We review data suggesting that pain of tendinopathy may be largely due to yet unidentified biochemical factors activating peritendinous nociceptors when they are exposed to the environs as a result of tendon overuse injury. The noxious agent could include matrix substances and minor collagens. Glutamate can mediate pain, and this is present in higher concentrations in subjects with Achilles tendinopathy than in controls. Chondroitin sulphate is another candidate. Examining alternative models of pain, particularly a mixed biochemical-mechanical model, may allow significant progress in management of these troublesome conditions.'],\n",

       "  '(0.427)  Purpose: Recognition of the importance and difficulty of engaging physicians in organisational change has sparked an explosion of literature. The social identity approach, by considering engagement in terms of underlying group identifications and intergroup dynamics, may provide a framework for choosing among the plethora of proposed engagement techniques. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined how four disparate organisations engaged physicians in change. Qualitative methods included interviews (109 managers and physicians), observation, and document review. Findings: Beyond a universal focus on relationship-building, sites differed radically in their preferred strategies. Each emphasised or downplayed professional and/or organisational identity as befit the existing level of inter-group closeness between physicians and managers: an independent practice association sought to enhance members\\' identity as independent physicians; a hospital, engaging community physicians suspicious of integration, stressed collaboration among separate, equal partners; a developing integrated-delivery system promoted alignment among diverse groups by balancing \"systemness\" with subgroup uniqueness; a medical group established a strong common identity among employed physicians, but practised pragmatic co-operation with its affiliates. Research limitations/implications: The authors cannot confirm the accuracy of managers\\' perceptions of the inter-group context or the efficacy of particular strategies. Nonetheless, the findings suggested the fruitfulness of social identity thinking in approaching physician engagement. Practical implications: Attention to inter-group dynamics may help organisations engage physicians more effectively. Originality/value: This study illuminates and explains variation in the way different organisations engage physicians, and offers a theoretical basis for selecting engagement strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.'],\n",

METHOD: Edge dimensions from 4 rectangular agar phantoms ranging from 10.5 to 14.5 mm in length and 1.25 to 5.5 mm in width were independently measured by two readers using a steel ruler. Coronal T1 spin echo (T1 SE), fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo (FSPGR) and multiplanar gradient-recalled echo (GRE MPGR) sequences were used to obtain phantom images on a 1.5-T scanner. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-reader reliability were high for both direct measurements and for magnetic resonance imaging measurements of phantoms. Statistically significant differences were noted between the mean direct measurements and the mean magnetic resonance imaging measurements for phantom 1 when using a GRE MPGR sequence (512x512 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 5: 49 min scan time), while borderline differences were noted for T1 SE sequences with the following parameters: 320x320 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 6: 11 min scan time; 320x320 pixels, 4-mm slice thickness, 6: 11 min scan time; and 512x512 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 9: 48 min scan time.

       "  '(0.721)  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union provides for an extension of Canadian patents for prescription drugs by up to 2 years. One of the arguments advanced for longer patent time is to compensate companies for the length of the overall drug development time (the time between patent application and market approval). This study investigates overall development time in Canada for different groups of drugs approved between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018 and how many of these drugs are eligible for up to 2 years of patent term extension. Based on a list of patents and dates of market approval, the change in overall development time for all drugs was calculated along with whether there were differences in development time between different groups of drugs. Using Canadian patent filing dates, overall development time for all drugs went from a mean of 2240 days (95% CI: 1832, 2648) in 2009 to 4197 days (95% CI: 3728, 4665) in 2018 (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < .0001). Using first global patent filing dates, overall development time went from a mean of 4481 days (95% CI: 3053, 5908) in 2009 to 6298 days (95% CI: 4839, 7756) in 2018 (ANOVA, P = .0118). There was a statistically significant difference in the overall development mean time between small molecule drugs (3553, 95% CI: 3361, 3746) and biologics (3903, 95% CI: 3595, 4212), (t test, P = .0487) when using Canadian patent filing dates but not when first global patent filing dates were used. There was no statistically significant change in overall development time among drugs that were substantial, moderate or little to none additional therapeutic value compared to existing drugs. Out of 238 drugs, 218 (91.6%) would have been eligible for patent term extension with 195 (80.7%) eligible for the full 2 years. Patent term extension does not appear to be justified based on changes in overall development time, except possibly in the case of biologics. There are also trade offs in terms of increased expenditures that need to be considered if patent terms are lengthened.',\n",

Dutch (DQ) and English (EQ) versions of the questionnaire were examined. METHODS: Fifty-one Flemish adults (ages 39.4 ± 11.1 yr) wore a thigh accelerometer (activPAL3\\x99) and simultaneously kept a domain log for 7 d. The DQ was subsequently completed twice (median test-retest interval: 3.3 wk). Thigh-acceleration sedentary time was log annotated to create comparable domain-specific and total sedentary time variables. Four hundred two English adults (ages 49.6 ± 7.3 yr) wore a combined accelerometer and HR monitor (Actiheart) for 6 d to objectively measure total sedentary time. The EQ was subsequently completed twice (median test-retest interval: 3.4 wk). In both samples, the questionnaire reference frame overlapped with the criterion measure administration period. All participants had five or more valid days of criterion data, including one or more weekend day. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI)) was fair to good for total sedentary time (DQ: 0.68 (0.50-0.81); EQ: 0.53 (0.44-0.62)) and poor to excellent for domain-specific sedentary time (DQ: from 0.36 (0.10-0.57) (meals) to 0.66 (0.46-0.79) (occupation); EQ: from 0.45 (0.35-0.54) (other sedentary time) to 0.76 (0.71-0.81) (meals)). For criterion validity (Spearman rho), significant correlations were found for total sedentary time (DQ: 0.52; EQ: 0.22; all P <0.001). Compared with domain-specific criterion variables (DQ), modest-to-strong correlations were found for domain-specific sedentary time (from 0.21 (meals) to 0.76 (P < 0.001) (screen time)). The questionnaire generally overestimated sedentary time compared with criterion measures.

Young children's screen-time behavior is strongly influenced by their environment and their parents' behavior. We explored whether parental television watching time, parental perceptions of children's screen time, and media-related resources in the home are related to screen time (ie, television, DVD/video, video game, and computer use) among Oglala Lakota youth residing on or near the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Methods: We collected baseline data from 431 child and parent/caregiver pairs who participated in Bright Start, a group-randomized, controlled, school-based obesity prevention trial to reduce excess weight gain. Controlling for demographic characteristics, we used linear regression analysis to assess associations between children's screen time and parental television watching time, parental perceptions of children's screen time, and availability of media-related household resources. Results: The most parsimonious model for explaining child screen time included the children's sex, parental body mass index, parental television watching time, how often the child watched television after school or in the evening, parental perception that the child spent too much time playing video games, how often the parent limited the child's television time, and the presence of a VCR/DVD player or video game player in the home (F 7,367 = 14.67; P < .001; adjusted R 2 = .37). The presence of a television in the bedroom did not contribute significantly to the model. Conclusion: Changes in parental television watching time, parental influence over children's screen-time behavior, and availability of media-related resources in the home could decrease screen time and may be used as a strategy for reducing overweight and obesity in American Indian children.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.584)  Introduction Studies of the delay between when companies file a New Drug Submission (NDS) and when drugs reach Canadian patients typically focus on the time in the regulatory review process and do not analyze the time between when approval is granted and the drug is available for purchase (company decision time). This study looks at the length of the two different time periods. Secondarily, it examines whether there is a difference in these time periods for drugs that received a standard review and those that received an expedited review. Methods A list of all New Active Substances approved in Canada between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 was compiled and the dates when the companies applied for a NDS, the dates when the drugs received a market authorization (Notice of Compliance, NOC) and whether the drugs received a standard review or an expedited review were recorded. The date of original marketing comes from Health Canada's Drug Product Database. Times in days were calculated between NDS and NOC (review time), between NOC and the marketing date (company decision time) and between NDS and the marketing date (total time). The company decision time as a percent of the total time was calculated for all drugs. Times were compared between standard and expedited review drugs using a twotailed t-test. Results One hundred and fifty-seven drugs were analyzed, 98 had a standard review and 59 had a priority review. Over 18% of the total time was due to company decisions. All three times were significantly lower for expedited review drugs versus standard review drugs as was the percent of total time due to company decision- 14.4% (95% CI 11.0, 17.8) versus 21.2% (95% CI 17.6, 24.8), p = 0.0102 (t-test). Conclusions Over 18% of the total time between when companies file for drug approval until the drug is available is due to decisions made by companies. Company decision times are shorter for drugs with expedited approvals compared to drugs with standard approvals.\"],\n",
       " ['(0.873)  People with dementia have problems carrying out multi-step tasks such as making a hot drink. Intelligent systems are being built to prompt people through such tasks. However, the prompts used by these systems are likely to be viewed as novel. As people with dementia are known to be sensitive to novelty this could be a problem. An experiment was performed to determine how to prompt people with dementia with which knob controls which burner on a cooking range. A highly novel implicit attentional cue using fluorescent wire was found to provide comparable or better results than more conventional alternatives. It is concluded that design in this area does not need to be constrained by the need to avoid novelty. The experiment is also of interest because of the way that it was embedded in a natural cooking task suitable for people of varied cognitive capacity.',\n",
       "  \"(0.699)  Purpose - There is a discrepancy between the ease of purchase of cigarettes reported by young people themselves and the results of ease of purchase obtained by tests done by official sources such as Trading Standards Units. This discrepancy suggests that either data from young people or from trading standards are unreliable. This research set out to find out whether young peoples' perceptions of easy purchasing from shops were true. Design/methodology/approach - Six volunteer young people visited shops around the West Midlands region and attempted to buy cigarettes. They conducted the attempt in as realistic fashion as possible. All volunteers were assessed independently as looking under 16. Shopkeeper, shop, area and youth attributes were recorded Findings - Young people were able to make purchases in 31 out of 38 shops. The young people were very surprised by their rates of successful purchase attempts across such a large geographical area. Practical implications - Shopkeepers and communities need to be given more help to recognise underage youth purchasers in order to reduce this important source of tobacco to young people. Trading standards protocols for test purchases need to be revised to reflect the reality of ease of purchasing for young people. Originality/value - This research confirms that young people who say that it is possible to buy cigarettes from shops appear to generally be correct in their perceptions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.611)  After a sudden traumatic death, bereaved relatives may feel particularly distressed. We look at the role of spirituality (including religion, whether following communal forms or more individually expressed) in people's lives after the traumatic death of a relative. Our findings are based on narrative interviews with 40 people bereaved through murder, manslaughter, car crash, train accident, fire, bomb explosion, industrial explosion, or pedestrian incident. People were interviewed in their homes throughout the UK. A qualitative interpretive approach was taken, combining thematic analysis with constant comparison. A few people said that after the death they felt angry or cynical about religion, but many people turned to spirituality or religion for help at this time. People reported that through spirituality or religion they found practical support, comfort, help in making sense of what had happened, belief in continued existence beyond death, a way of ensuring 'continuing bonds', and healing. Despite declining church attendance and a decline in the number of people who call themselves Christians, it seems that in the UK religion still remains important for people bereaved by a traumatic death. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.\",\n",

Progress in meeting the aims of the NSFOP was evaluated by a mid-term independent review led by the Healthcare Commission, the body responsible for regulating health-care services in England. This paper reports the consultation with older people that underpinned the evaluation. It focuses on the views and experiences of older people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups and of the staff that work in BME voluntary organisations. A rapid appraisal approach was used in 10 purposively selected local councils, and plural methods were used, including public listening events, nominal groups and individual interviews. In total 1,839 older people participated in the consultations and 1,280 (70%) completed a monitoring form. Some 30 per cent defined themselves as of a minority ethnic background. The concerns were more about the low recognition of culturally-specific and language needs than for the development of services exclusively for BME older people. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.',\n",

       " ['(0.765)  Natural Killer (NK) cell responses to HIV-infected CD4 T cells (iCD4) depend on the integration of signals received through inhibitory (iNKR) and activating NK receptors (aNKR). iCD4 activate NK cells to inhibit HIV replication. HIV infection-dependent changes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands for iNKR on iCD4 are well documented. By contrast, less is known regarding the HIV infection related changes in ligands for aNKR on iCD4. We examined the aNKR ligand profiles HIV p24+ HIV iCD4s that maintained cell surface CD4 (iCD4+), did not maintain CD4 (iCD4-) and uninfected CD4 (unCD4) T cells for expression of unique long (UL)-16 binding proteins-1 (ULBP-1), ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1-related (MIC)-A, MIC-B, CD48, CD80, CD86, CD112, CD155, Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-A2, HLA-C, and the ligands to NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DS1 (KIR3DS1) by flow cytometry on CD4 T cells from 17 HIV-1 seronegative donors activated and infected with HIV. iCD4+ cells had higher expression of aNKR ligands than did unCD4. However, the expression of aNKR ligands on iCD4 where CD4 was downregulated (iCD4-) was similar to (ULBP-1, ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, MIC-A, CD48, CD80, CD86 and CD155) or significantly lower than (MIC-B, CD112 and ICAM-2) what was observed on unCD4. Thus, HIV infection can be associated with increased expression of aNKR ligands or either baseline or lower than baseline levels of aNKR ligands, concomitantly with the HIV-mediated downregulation of cell surface CD4 on infected cells.',\n",

Increasing access to HIV testing is necessary and community-based rapid testing offers one strategy. This paper examines the clienteles and activities of a rapid HIV testing site in Montreal, the pilot project Actuel sur Rue. Comparative analyses were conducted with 1357 MSM, 147 heterosexual men and 64 women who visited Actuel sur Rue between July 2012 and November 2013 on socio-demographics, health, drug use, sexual practices/infection and HIV testing/prevention. Significant group differences were observed in each category. Actuel sur Rue received 1901 clients, conducted 1417 rapid HIV tests and tested 77 never-tested individuals. Rapid testing produced a high reactive rate (2%). Only 1/28 of those with reactive tests had no previous HIV testing, and 36% had used post-exposure prophylaxis, suggesting missed opportunities for prevention. Findings highlight diverse client vulnerability profiles and the relevance of checkpoints and further prevention efforts.',\n",

For AVT, staff used a mobile clinic to conduct HIV testing. For PR, staff solicited contact information from HIV-infected AA MSM, located contacts and offered HIV testing. For SNS, HIV-positive AA MSM recruited network associates for HIV testing. Two hundred and eighteen self-identified AA MSM were tested through AVT (25.2% HIV positivity) of whom 20 were newly identified HIV-positive. Fourteen HIV-positive men participated in SNS; 22 AA MSM contacts were recruited through SNS, eight (36.4%) were HIV positive and none were new positives. Two HIV-infected men participated in the PR strategy, yielding two AA MSM sex partners (one previously positive). The results suggest the need for health departments to consider using several complimentary strategies for identifying previously undiagnosed HIV infections in AA MSM in urban environments such as Baltimore. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.',\n",
       "  '(0.703)  HIV is generally sexually acquired across the genital or rectal mucosa after exposure to the genital secretions of an HIV-infected partner. Most exposures to HIV do not result in infection, likely due to protection afforded by an intact mucosal epithelium, as well as by innate and adaptive mucosal immune factors present in the genital tract. Another important mucosal determinant of transmission may be the number and activation status of potential HIV target cells, including CCR5/CD4+ T cells and DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells. The simultaneous presence of other genital infections, including classical sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can enhance HIV susceptibility either by breaching the epithelial barrier, recruiting HIV target cells to the genital tract, or by generating a pro-inflammatory local immune milieu. In HIV-infected individuals, genital co-infections increase HIV levels in the genital secretions, thereby increasing secondary sexual transmission. Co-infections that act as important HIV cofactors include human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and many others. Strategies focused on genital co-infections, such as vaccines, microbicides and suppressive therapy, are feasible in the short term and have the potential to curb the pandemic. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

       "  '(0.677)  Public health messages shape how the world understands the HIV epidemic. Considerable inequalities remain in HIV care continuum indicators by subpopulation and geography (eg, highest infection and mortality burden among men who have sex with men and people who live in sub-Saharan Africa). Health equity-focused approaches are necessary in this next decade to close gaps in the HIV epidemic. Between 1981 and 1989, HIV messages triggered fear and victim blaming, and highlighted behaviours of a few marginalised groups as deviant. Between 1990 and 1999, messages signalled that HIV was a growing challenge for the world and required multisector approaches that addressed structural drivers of inequality. Between 2000 and 2009, messages highlighted universal testing, while advances in HIV testing made these messages easier for individuals to respond to than in previous decades. Currently, messages signal that ending HIV is possible, people can live productive lives with HIV, and transmission to people without HIV can be eliminated. Public health messaging about the HIV epidemic has evolved substantially over the past 40 years. Future HIV messaging should be driven by health equity principles that include an increased representation of key populations in message design and dissemination, transparency of funding, and communicating any impact that campaigns have had on closing health inequalities.'],\n",
       " ['(0.809)  Although the terms \"health equity\" and \"health disparities\" have become increasingly familiar to health professionals in the United States over the past two decades, they are rarely defined. Federal agencies have often defined \"health disparities\" in ways that encompass all health differences between any groups. Lack of clarity about the concepts of health disparities and health equity can have serious consequences for how resources are allocated, by removing social justice as an explicit consideration from policy agendas. This paper aims to make explicit what these concepts mean and to discuss what a life-course perspective can contribute to efforts to achieve health equity and eliminate health disparities. Equity means justice. Health equity is the principle or goal that motivates efforts to eliminate disparities in health between groups of people who are economically or socially worse-off and their better-off counterparts - such as different racial/ethnic or socioeconomic groups or groups defined by disability status, sexual orientation, or gender identity - by making special efforts to improve the health of those who are economically or socially disadvantaged. Health disparities are the metric by which we measure progress toward health equity. The basis for these definitions in ethical and human rights principles is discussed, along with the relevance of a life-course perspective for moving toward greater health equity © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.',\n",
       "  \"(0.793)  Those concerned with poverty and health have sometimes viewed equity and human rights as abstract concepts with little practical application, and links between health, equity and human rights have not been examined systematically. Examination of the concepts of poverty, equity, and human rights in relation to health and to each other demonstrates that they are closely linked conceptually and operationally and that each provides valuable, unique guidance for health institutions' work. Equity and human rights perspectives can contribute concretely to health institutions' efforts to tackle poverty and health, and focusing on poverty is essential to operationalizing those commitments. Both equity and human rights principles dictate the necessity to strive for equal opportunity for health for groups of people who leave suffered marginalization or discrimination. Health institutions can deal with poverty and health within a framework encompassing equity and human rights concerns in five general ways: (1) institutionalizing the sytematic and ruotine application of equity and human rights perspectives to all health sector actions; (2) strengthening and extending the public health functions, other than health care, that create the conditions necessary for health; (3) implementing equitable health care financing, which should help reduce poverty while increasing access for the poor; (4) ensuring that health services respond effectively to the major causes of preventable ill-health among the poor and disadvantaged; and (5) monotoring, advocating and taking action to address the potential health equity and human rights implications of policies in all sectors affecting health, not only the health sector.\",\n",

       "  '(0.695)  Public health is complex and previous work has demonstrated the value of systems modelling in understanding its complexity. Today the need for systems modelling in public health has increased because the delivery of the public health function is being reengineered with an additional layer of complexity. The service is now more distributed and as a consequence there is a demand that information and communication technologies (ICT) should be employed to a greater extent in ensuring public health provision. It is essential that a good public health service is maintained within this new framework and the public health network (PHN) has been proposed as the solution. We aim to demonstrate the potential value of systems modelling in this newly re-engineered public health environment by showing how it can be used to convert the complex input of the public health network project into a realistic, holistic and potentially successful plan to implement and evaluate the network.

A universal paediatric influenza vaccination programme using a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has recently been introduced in the UK. This study aims to measure the end-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), including for LAIV, using the test negative case\\x96control design. The overall adjusted VE against all influenza was 34.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.8 to 47.5); for A(H3N2) 29.3% (95% CI: 8.6 to 45.3) and for B 46.3% (95% CI: 13.9 to 66.5). For those aged under 18 years, influenza A(H3N2) LAIV VE was 35% (95% CI: -29.9 to 67.5), whereas for influenza B the LAIV VE was 100% (95% CI:17.0 to 100.0). Although the VE against influenza A(H3N2) infection was low, there was still evidence of significant protection, together with moderate, significant protection against drifted circulating influenza B viruses.

       "  '(0.668)  Background: Given the variation in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage across Canada, and debate regarding delivery of HPV vaccines in Catholic schools, we studied online comments on Canadian news websites to understand public perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccine. Methods: We searched English- and French-language Canadian news websites for 2012 articles that contained the terms \"HPV\" or \"human papillomavirus.\" Articles about HPV vaccinations that contained at least one comment were included. Two researchers independently coded comments, analyzing them for emerging themes. Results: We identified 3073 comments from 1198 individuals in response to 71 news articles; 630 (52.6%) individuals expressed positive sentiments about HPV vaccination (2.5 comments/individual), 404 (33.7%) were negative (3.0 comments/individual), 34 (2.8%) were mixed (1.5 comments/individual) and 130 (10.8%) were neutral (1.6 comments/individual). Vaccine-supportive commenters believed the vaccine is safe and effective. Common themes in negative comments included concerns regarding HPV vaccine safety and efficacy, distrust of pharmaceutical companies and government, and belief that school-age children are too young for HPV vaccine. Many comments focused on whether the Catholic Church has the right to inform health policy for students, and discussion often evolved into debates regarding HPV and sexual behaviour. We noted that many individuals doubted the credibility of vaccine safety information. Conclusion: The majority of commenters do not appear to be against HPV vaccination, but public health messaging that focuses on both the vaccine\\'s safety profile, and its use as a means to prevent cancer rather than sexually transmitted HPV infection may facilitate its acceptance.',\n",

These estimates demonstrate moderate to good levels of protection, particularly against influenza B in children, but relatively less against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Despite lineage mismatch in the trivalent IIV, adults younger than 65 years were still protected against influenza B.

Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on Markov modelling over 5 years, from a Hong Kong public health provider's perspective, on a hypothetical cohort of LTCF residents aged =65 years. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and net present value (NPV) of two vaccination strategies versus no vaccination were estimated. The cost and QALYs gained by two vaccination strategies were compared by Student's t-test in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10 000 Monte Carlo simulations). Results: Both vaccination strategies had high BCRs and NPVs (6.39 and US$334 for influenza vaccination; 5.10 and US$332 for influenza plus pneumococcal vaccination). In base case analysis, the two vaccination strategies were expected to cost less and gain higher QALYs than no vaccination. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost of combined vaccination and influenza vaccination was significantly lower (p<0.001) than the cost of no vaccination. Both vaccination strategies gained significantly higher (p<0.001) QALYs than no vaccination. The QALYs gained by combined vaccination were significantly higher (p=0.030) than those gained by influenza vaccination alone. The total cost of combined vaccination was significantly lower (p=0.011) than that of influenza vaccination. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination appears to be less costly with higher QALYs gained than no vaccination, over a 5-year period, for elderly people living in LTCFs from the perspective of a Hong Kong public health organisation. Combined vaccination was more likely to gain higher QALYs with lower total cost than influenza vaccination alone.\",\n",

Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: current season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (dVE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241). Results: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (dVE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (dVE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (dVE = 7%; 95% CI - 7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the current season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (dVE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (dVE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (dVE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the current season only for H1N1 (dVE = 3%; 95% CI - 8%, 13%), but less protection against influenza H3N2 (dVE = - 20%; 95% CI - 36%, - 4%), and B (dVE = - 11%; 95% CI - 20%, - 2%). Conclusions: Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes, and for H1N1 and influenza B, vaccination in both seasons provides better VE than vaccination in the prior season only. Although VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only, it should be noted that past vaccination history cannot be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only. In addition, our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014-2015 influenza season and the impact of repeated vaccination for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season. It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail.\"],\n",

Summary of Background Data. The rates of spine surgery in the United States have increased along with a concurrent rise in the use of advanced spinal imaging: CT and MRI. Spine surgery rates vary six-fold across geographic areas of the United States. Differences in patient populations and health care supply have explained only about 10% of this variation. Methods. We used a random 5% sample of Medicare's National Claims History Part B files for 1996 and 1997 to determine procedure rates across 306 Hospital Referral Regions. We analyzed the association between spinal imaging and spine surgery using linear regression. Main outcome measures were rates of procedures and coefficients of determination (R2). Results. The rates of advanced spinal imaging (CT and MRI combined) varied 5.5-fold across geographic areas. Areas with higher rates of MRI had higher rates of spine surgery overall (r = 0.46) and spinal stenosis surgery specifically (r = 0.37). The rates of advanced spinal imaging accounted for 22% of the variability in overall spine surgery rates (R2 = 0.22, P < 0.001) and 14% of the variability in lumbar stenosis surgery rates (R2 = 0.14, P < 0.001). A simulation model showed that MRIs obtained in the patients undergoing surgery accounted for only a small part of the correlation between MRI and total spine surgery rates. Conclusions. A significant proportion of the variation in rates of spine surgery can be explained by differences in the rates of advanced spinal imaging. The indications for advanced spinal imaging are not firmly agreed on, and the appropriateness of many of these imaging studies has been questioned. Improved consensus on the use and interpretation of advanced spinal imaging studies could have an important effect on variation in spine surgery rates.\",\n",

Lumbar fusion rates have increased dramatically during the 1980s and even more so in the 1990s. The most rapid increase appeared to follow the approval of a new surgical implant device. METHODS. Medicare claims and enrollment data were used to calculate age, sex, and race-adjusted rates of lumbar laminectomy/discectomy and lumbar fusion for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 in each of the 306 US Hospital Referral Regions between 1992 and 2003. RESULTS. Lumbar fusion rates have increased steadily since 1992 (0.3 per 1000 enrollees in 1992 to 1.1 per 1000 enrollees in 2003). Regional rates of lumbar discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion in 1992-1993 were highly correlated to rates of discectomy, laminectomy (R = 0.44), and fusion (R = 0.28) in 2002-2003. There was a nearly 8-fold variation in regional rates of lumbar discectomy and laminectomy in 2002 and 2003. In the case of lumbar fusion, there was nearly a 20-fold range in rates among Medicare enrollees in 2002 and 2003. This represents the largest coefficient of variation seen with any surgical procedure. Medicare spending for inpatient back surgery more than doubled over the decade. Spending for lumbar fusion increased more than 500%, from $75 million to $482 million. In 1992, lumbar fusion represented 14% of total spending for back surgery; by 2003, lumbar fusion accounted for 47% of spending. CONCLUSIONS. The rate of specific procedures within a region or \"surgical signature\" is remarkably stable over time. However, there has been a marked increase in rates of fusion, and a coincident shift and increase in cost. Rates of back surgery were not correlated with the per-capita supply of orthopedic and neurosurgeons. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.',\n",
       "  '(0.59)  Introduction Suicide rates and the proportion of alcohol-involved suicides rose during the 2008\\x962009 recession. Associations between county-level poverty, foreclosures, and unemployment and suicide rates and proportion of alcohol-involved suicides were investigated. Methods In 2015, National Violent Death Reporting System data from 16 states in 2005\\x962011 were utilized to calculate suicide rates and a measure of alcohol involvement in suicides at the county level. Panel models with year and state fixed effects included county-level measures of unemployment, foreclosure, and poverty rates. Results Poverty rates were strongly associated with suicide rates for both genders and all age groups, were positively associated with alcohol involvement in suicides for men aged 45\\x9664 years, and negatively associated for men aged 20\\x9644 years. Foreclosure rates were negatively associated with suicide rates for women and those aged =65 years but positively related for those aged 45\\x9664 years. Unemployment rate effects on suicide rates were mediated by poverty rates in all groups. Conclusions Population risk of suicide was most clearly associated with county-level poverty rates, indicating that programs addressing area poverty should be targeted for reducing suicide risk. Poverty rates were also associated with increased alcohol involvement for men aged 45\\x9664 years, indicating a role for alcohol in suicide for this working-aged group. However, negative associations between economic indicators and alcohol involvement were found for four groups, suggesting that non-economic factors or more general economic effects not captured by these indicators may have played a larger role in alcohol-related suicide increases.'],\n",
       " ['(0.446)  The TABLE summarizes the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with regard to adolescent screening. We identified no additional evidence-based recommendations for screening tests for adolescents. As shown in the TABLE, rubella susceptibility screening is recommended for all adolescent females (SOR: B). Sexually active adolescent females should routinely be screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and cervical cancer. Adolescents at risk of contracting TB, HIV, or syphilis should be screened for those diseases. Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against performing the following tests for adolescents: hearing loss screening, anemia screening, clinical or self breast examination, blood pressure screening, screening for overweight, screening for alcohol misuse, screening for depression, and suicide risk screening. For males, evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against: rubella screening, routine rubella vaccination, and chlamydia or gonorrhea screening for sexually active males. Do not perform the following tests on adolescents because evidence is good that the harms outweigh the benefits: testicular cancer screening using clinical or self-testicular examination, hepatitis B screening, screening for herpes, thyroid cancer screening, screening for scoliosis, and bacteriuria screening in asymptomatic non-pregnant adolescents. Screening for lipid disorders is recommended only for those over age 20 years who have significant risks for coronary artery disease.',\n",
       "  '(0.423)  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is increasing worldwide. A high proportion of individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but RCC has a high mortality rate. These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.',\n",
       "  \"(0.423)  Given current policy that decisions about screening should be based on informed choice, such decisions should reflect people's values and attitudes. This prospective study compares the attitudes and other cognitive predictors of screening uptake in two contexts: when conducted as part of a routine visit and when it is conducted at a separate, test-specific visit. It was conducted in two hospitals in England, differing in method of screening organisation. 1499 pregnant women offered serum screening for Down Syndrome completed a questionnaire assessing theory of planned behaviour constructs: attitude towards undergoing the test, subjective norms of others, perceived behavioural control and intention to undergo the test. Intention predicted screening uptake in both screening settings, but more strongly when screening was part of a routine visit. Perceived behavioural control was not predictive of uptake, and only weakly predictive of intention in both settings. Subjective norm predicted intention more strongly when it referred to partner and friends than when it referred to health professionals, in both settings. Attitude was more strongly predictive of intention to attend screening when screening was organised as a part of routine screening, rather than requiring a separate visit. These results suggest that offering a screening test at a routine visit compared with a separate visit is more likely to facilitated uninformed choices, given the stronger association between attitudes and intention and the absence of an association with the perceived influence of health professionals.\",\n",
       "  '(0.416)  Background: To determine the impact of a co-payment on the cost-effectiveness of systematic screening for diabetic retinopathy in Hong Kong (HK). Methods: An analysis was conducted from provider and societal perspectives. A Markov cohort model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening with a co-payment of HK$60 (US$7.7) compared with free screening, with and without an assumption that the inverse care law (ICL) would operate in the presence of a fee as seen in our previous data. Results: From the provider perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of free versus pay systematic screening was HK$166 558 (US$21 354)/extra quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained assuming an effect of the ICL and free screening was always more cost-effective than pay screening when willingness to pay for a QALY was HK$124 488 (US$15 960) or above. Without an effect of the ICL, the ICER was HK$480 479 (US$61 600)/extra QALY gained. From the societal perspective, the ICER was HK$144 046 (US$18 467)/extra QALY gained with an effect of the ICL and HK$199 741 (US$25 608)/extra QALY gained with no effect. Conclusions: Free systematic screening was highly cost-effective from the societal perspective compared with screening with a small co-payment irrespective of the effects of the ICL. From the provider perspective, free screening was highly cost-effective if the ICL operates.',\n",
       "  \"(0.415)  Background: U.S. professional organizations increasingly agree that most women require Papanicolaou smear screening every 2 to 3 years rather than annually and that most elderly women may stop screening. We sought to describe the attitudes of women in the United States toward less intense screening, specifically, less frequent screening and eventual cessation of screening. Methods: We conducted a random-digit-dialing telephone survey of women in 2002 (response rate of 75% among eligible women reached by telephone). A nationally representative sample of 360 women aged 40 years or older with no history of cancer was surveyed about their acceptance of less intense screening. Results: Almost all women aged 40 years or older (99%) had had at least one Pap smear; most (59%) were screened annually. When women were asked to choose their preferred frequency for screening, 75% preferred screening at least annually (12% chose screening every 6 months). Less than half (43%) had heard of recommendations advocating less frequent screening. When advised of such recommendations, half of all women believed that they were based on cost. Sixty-nine percent said that they would try to continue being screened annually even if their doctors recommended less frequent screening and advised them of comparable benefits. Only 35% of women thought that there might come a time when they would stop getting Pap smears; of these, almost half would not stop until after age 80 years. The strongest predictor of reluctance to reduce the frequency of screening was a belief that cost was the basis of current screening frequency recommendations. Conclusion: Most women in the United States prefer annual Pap smears and are resistant to the idea of less intense screening. Concern that cost considerations rather than evidence form the basis of screening recommendations may partly explain women's reluctance to accept less intense screening. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

       " ['(0.693)  Objective: To evaluate the prognostic utility of the presence, persistence, and patterns of depression in subjects with anmestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Method: Sixty amnestic MCI patients were assessed cognitively and for presence of depression using the 30 item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). They were followed annually for an average period of 4.3 years. Results: Simple presence or absence of depression at referral did not predict progression of MCI to AD. Positive answers to specific GDS questions referring to \"melancholic\" affect as well as the persistence of depression over two to three years significantly predicted cognitive deterioration leading to AD. Conclusion: The affective characteristics of depression at referral and the persistence of depression were better predictors of conversion to AD than the simple presence or absence of depression measured at referral time.

Recognising that the categories 'homosexual' and 'depression' were socially constructed and stigmatised from the 19 th and 20 th centuries respectively, we draw on themes in conceptual models of coming out as gay or lesbian to sensitise our analysis to personal experiences of depression and the specific ways in which the condition is constructed. Thirty-eight narrative interviews with people in the UK in various stages of recovery from depression were analysed comparing themes to a 'coming out' framework. The applicability of coming out themes to understanding the construction of depression was evident. Themes included childhood difference; confusion; the depression closet; challenging stigma via the biology vs. nurture debate; re-casting depression as commonplace or even fashionable; contending with a shame-pride narrative; coming out and, finally, integrating the depression experience. By comparing 'coming out' themes with depression experience in detail for the first time, we illuminate how people understand depression, cope with and resist stigma, thus providing insights into the contemporary situation in Western societies for those facing depression. © 2011 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.576)  Objective Depression is a potential risk factor for developing IBD. This association may be related to GI symptoms occurring before diagnosis. We aimed to determine whether depression, adjusted for pre-existing GI symptoms, is associated with subsequent IBD. Design We conducted a nested case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink identifying incident cases of UC and Crohn's disease (CD) from 1998 to 2016. Controls without IBD were matched for age and sex. We measured exposure to prevalent depression 4.5-5.5 years before IBD diagnosis. We created two sub-groups with prevalent depression based on whether individuals had reported GI symptoms before the onset of depression. We used conditional logistic regression to derive ORs for the risk of IBD depending on depression status. Results We identified 10 829 UC cases, 4531 CD cases and 15 360 controls. There was an excess of prevalent depression 5 years before IBD diagnosis relative to controls (UC: 3.7% vs 2.7%, CD 3.7% vs 2.9%). Individuals with GI symptoms prior to the diagnosis of depression had increased adjusted risks of developing UC and CD compared with those without depression (UC: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.79; CD: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.92). Individuals with depression alone had similar risks of UC and CD to those without depression (UC: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; CD: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.38). Conclusions Depression, in the absence of prior GI symptoms, is not associated with subsequent development of IBD. However, depression with GI symptoms should prompt investigation for IBD.\",\n",
       "  '(0.538)  During the last two decades, postnatal depression has become a widely accepted and very popular psychiatric diagnosis, in both scientific and lay writings. Despite its popularity, the postnatal depression diagnosis has raised many questions and controversies, particularly around the specific character of depression during the postpartum period. In order to shed light to this paradox, we first examine the arguments used to justify the distinctive character of the postnatal depression diagnostic category. Second, we explore some driving forces that may have contributed to the legitimacy of this diagnosis: professional factors and general public discourses. Regardless of assumptions taken for granted about the specificity of the postnatal depression diagnosis, there is no consensus about its definition. Furthermore, its symptoms and contributing risk factors do not seem to differ from those present in major depression episodes suffered at any other lifespan period. In such a context, the high legitimacy of this diagnostic category might be linked to the development of specific tools conceived for measuring postnatal depression, the progressive medicalisation of different spheres of social life in general, and women lives in particular; and contemporary changes in the institution of motherhood. © Common Ground, Catherine des Rivières-Pigeon, Charo Rodríguez, Gabrielle Nicole All Rights Reserved.',\n",
       "  '(0.523)  This research aims to identify distinct courses of depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older Americans and to ascertain how these courses vary by race/ethnicity. Data came from the 1995-2006 Health and Retirement Study which involved a national sample of 17,196 Americans over 50 years of age with up to six repeated observations. Depressive symptoms were measured by an abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Semiparametric group based mixture models (Proc Traj) were used for data analysis. Six major trajectories were identified: (a) minimal depressive symptoms (15.9%), (b) low depressive symptoms (36.3%), (c) moderate and stable depressive symptoms (29.2%), (d) high but decreasing depressive symptoms (6.6%), (e) moderate but increasing depressive symptoms (8.3%), and (f) persistently high depressive symptoms (3.6%). Adjustment of time-varying covariates (e.g., income and health conditions) resulted in a similar set of distinct trajectories. Relative to White Americans, Black and Hispanic Americans were significantly more likely to be in trajectories of more elevated depressive symptoms. In addition, they were more likely to experience increasing and decreasing depressive symptoms. Racial and ethnic variations in trajectory groups were partially mediated by SES, marital status, and health conditions, particularly when both interpersonal and intrapersonal differences in these variables were taken into account. © 2011 American Psychological Association.'],\n",
       " ['(0.626)  Despite growing numbers of American Muslims, little empirical work exists on their use of traditional healing practices. We explored the types of traditional healing practices used by American Muslims in southeast Michigan. Twelve semi-structured interviews with American Muslim community leaders identified through a community-academic steering committee were conducted. Using a framework coding structure, a multidisciplinary investigative team identified themes describing traditional healing practices. Traditional healing practices can be categorized into three domains: Islamic religious text based practices, Islamic worship practices, and folk healing practices. Each domain may further contain therapies such as spiritual healing, medicinal herbs, mind body therapy, and dietary prescriptions. Traditional healing practices are utilized in three capacities of care: primary, secondary, and integrative. Our findings demonstrate that AmericanMuslims actively utilize traditional healing practices.

       "  '(0.509)  Background: Limited data exist to estimate the use of electronic health records (EHRs) in ambulatory care practices in the United States. Methods: We surveyed a stratified random sample of 1829 office practices in Massachusetts in 2005. The one-page survey measured use of health information technology, plans for EHR adoption and perceived barriers to adoption. Results: A total of 847 surveys were returned, for a response rate of 46%. Overall, 18% of office practices reported having an EHR. Primary-care-only and mixed practices reported similar adoption rates (23% and 25%, respectively, P = 0.70). The adoption rate in specialty practices (14%) was lower compared with both primary-care-only (P < 0.01) and mixed (P < 0.05) practices. The number of clinicians in the practice strongly correlated with EHR adoption (P < 0.001), with fewer small practices adopting EHRs. Among practices that have EHRs with laboratory and radiology result retrieval capabilities, at least 87% of practices report that a majority of their clinicians actively use these functionalities, while 74% of practices with electronic decision support report that the majority of clinicians actively use it. Among the practices without an EHR, 13% plan to implement one within the next 12 months, 24% within the next 1-2 years, 11% within the next 3-5 years, and 52% reported having no plans to implement an EHR in the foreseeable future. The most frequently reported barrier to implementation was lack of adequate funding (42%). Conclusions: Overall, fewer than 1 in 5 medical practices in Massachusetts have an EHR. Even among adopters, though, doctor usage of EHR functions varied considerably by functionality and across practices. Many clinicians are not actively using functionalities that are necessary to improve health care quality and patient safety. Furthermore, among practices that do not have EHRs, more than half have no plan for adoption.

       "  '(0.468)  Objective. To describe physician practices, ranging from solo and two-physician practices to large medical groups, in three geographically diverse parts of the country with strong managed care presences. Data Sources/Study Design. Surveys of medical practices in three managed care markets conducted in 2000-2001. Study Design. We administered questionnaires to all medical practices affiliated with two large health plans in Boston, MA, and Portland, OR, and to all practices providing primary care for cardiovascular disease patients admitted to five large hospitals in Minneapolis, MN. We offer data on how physician practices are structured under managed care in these geographically diverse regions of the country with a focus on the structural characteristics, financial arrangements, and care management strategies adopted by practices. Data Collection. A two-staged survey consisting of an initial telephone survey that was undertaken using CATI (computerized assisted telephone interviewing) techniques followed by written modules triggered by specific responses to the telephone survey. Principal Findings. We interviewed 468 practices encompassing 668 distinct sites of care (overall response rate 72 percent). Practices had an average of 13.9 member physicians (range: 1-125). Most (80.1 percent) medium- (four to nine physicians) and large-size (10 or more physicians) groups regularly scheduled meetings to discuss resource utilization and referrals. Almost 90 percent of the practices reported that these meetings occurred at least once per month. The predominant method for paying practices was via fee-for-service payments. Most other payments were in the form of capitation. Overall, 75 percent of physician practices compensated physicians based on productivity, but there was substantial variation related to practice size. Nonetheless, of the practices that did not use straight productivity methods (45 percent of medium-sized practices and 54 percent of large practices), most used arrangements consisting of combinations of salary and productivity formulas. Conclusions. We found diversity in the characteristics and capabilities of medical practices in these three markets with high managed care involvement. Financial practices of most practices are geared towards rewarding productivity, and care management practices and capabilities such as electronic medical records remain underdeveloped.',\n",
       "  \"(0.437)  Objectives Approximately one in eight practices in primary care in England are 'dispensing practices' with an in-house dispensary providing medication directly to patients. These practices can generate additional income by negotiating lower prices on higher cost drugs, while being reimbursed at a standard rate. They, therefore, have a potential financial conflict of interest around prescribing choices. We aimed to determine whether dispensing practices are more likely to prescribe high-cost options for four commonly prescribed classes of drug where there is no evidence of superiority for high-cost options. Design A list was generated of drugs with high acquisition costs that were no more clinically effective than those with the lowest acquisition costs, for all four classes of drug examined. Data were obtained prescribing of statins, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEis). Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs for prescribing high-cost options in dispensing practices, adjusting for Index of Multiple Deprivation score, practice list size and the number of doctors at each practice. Setting English primary care. Participants All general practices in England. Main outcome measures Mean cost per dose was calculated separately for dispensing and non-dispensing practices. Dispensing practices can vary in the number of patients they dispense to; we, therefore, additionally compared practices with no dispensing patients, low, medium and high proportions of dispensing patients. Total cost savings were modelled by applying the mean cost per dose from non-dispensing practices to the number of doses prescribed in dispensing practices. Results Dispensing practices were more likely to prescribe high-cost drugs across all classes: statins adjusted OR 1.51 (95% CI 1.49 to 1.53, p<0.0001), PPIs OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.13, p<0.0001), ACEi OR 2.58 (95% CI 2.46 to 2.70, p<0.0001), ARB OR 5.11 (95% CI 5.02 to 5.20, p<0.0001). Mean cost per dose in pence was higher in dispensing practices (statins 7.44 vs 6.27, PPIs 5.57 vs 5.46, ACEi 4.30 vs 4.24, ARB 11.09 vs 8.19). For all drug classes, the more dispensing patients a practice had, the more likely it was to issue a prescription for a high-cost option. Total cost savings in England available from all four classes are £628 875 per month or £7 546 502 per year. Conclusions Doctors in dispensing practices are more likely to prescribe higher cost drugs. This is the largest study ever conducted on dispensing practices, and the first contemporary research suggesting some UK doctors respond to a financial conflict of interest in treatment decisions. The reimbursement system for dispensing practices may generate unintended consequences. Robust routine audit of practices prescribing higher volumes of unnecessarily expensive drugs may help reduce costs.\",\n",

Dual trajectory analysis enables examination of the interrelationship between two outcomes simultaneously. This paper describes the application of the group-based dual trajectory model in mental health and substance abuse research. We analyzed two related recovery outcomes: 1) social contact with non-substance abusing friends and 2) stage of substance abuse treatment. We identified four groups for social contact and four groups for substance abuse treatment. We then examined the interrelationship between the two outcomes across the trajectory groups over 10 years. The two outcomes are positively associated longitudinally and evolve in the same direction, although for specific groups, the two outcomes do not covary. By examining dynamic linkages across all trajectory groups between two longitudinal outcomes, the dual model provides a more comprehensive and realistic understanding of the underlying relationships between the two outcomes under investigation. © 2009 by the Journal of Drug Issues.',\n",

The UK Registry analysis was undertaken to determine transplant outcomes in recipients of kidneys from donors who died following ligature asphyxiation. From 2003 to 2016, 2.7% (n\\xa0=\\xa0521) of potential organ donors died following ligature asphyxiation (mostly suicide by hanging). Of these, 409 (78.5%) donated kidneys for transplantation (46.9% donation after brain death [DBD] and 53.1% DCD donors) resulting in 650 kidney transplants. Compared to other deceased donors, those dying from ligature asphyxiation were younger, more often male, and had less hypertension. Unadjusted patient and graft survival were superior for recipients of both DBD and DCD kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation, although after adjustment for donor/recipient variables, transplant outcomes were similar. A case\\x96control matched analysis confirmed transplant outcomes for those who received kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation were similar to controls. Although caution is required in interpreting these findings because of potential selection bias, kidneys from donors dying of ligature asphyxiation suffer an additional warm ischemic insult that does not apparently adversely influence transplant outcomes, even for kidneys from DCD donors.',\n",

Here we present a meta-analysis of the associations between MSDP and placental DNA methylation (DNAm) and between DNAm and birth outcomes within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium (N = 1700, 344 with MSDP). We identify 443 CpGs that are associated with MSDP, of which 142 associated with birth outcomes, 40 associated with gene expression, and 13 CpGs are associated with all three. Only two CpGs have consistent associations from a prior meta-analysis of cord blood DNAm, demonstrating substantial tissue-specific responses to MSDP. The placental MSDP-associated CpGs are enriched for environmental response genes, growth-factor signaling, and inflammation, which play important roles in placental function. We demonstrate links between placental DNAm, MSDP and poor birth outcomes, which may better inform the mechanisms through which MSDP impacts placental function and fetal growth.',\n",

Knowledge of kinematic variables that are predictive of kinetic outcomes could inform clinic-based gait retraining programs. Healthy novice female runners ran on a treadmill while 3-dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Kinetic outcomes consisted of vertical impact transient, average vertical loading rate, instantaneous vertical loading rate, and peak braking force. Kinematic outcomes included step length), hip flexion angle at initial contact, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass at initial contact, shank angle at initial contact, and foot strike angle. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the amount of variance in kinetic outcomes explained by kinematic outcomes. A moderate amount of variance in kinetic outcomes (vertical impact transient = 46%, average vertical loading rate = 37%, instantaneous vertical loading rate = 49%, peak braking force = 54%) was explained by several discrete kinematic variables\\x97predominantly speed, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass, foot strike angle, and step length. Hip flexion angle and shank angle did not contribute to any models. Decreasing step length and transitioning from a rearfoot strike may reduce kinetic risk factors for running-related injuries. In contrast, clinical strategies such as modifying shank angle and hip flexion angle would not appear to contribute significantly to the variance of kinetic outcomes after accounting for other variables.',\n",

Design: Mixed methods study. Setting: A core outcome set for pre-eclampsia was used as an exemplar. Sample: A long list of potential core outcomes was developed by undertaking a systematic review of pre-eclampsia trials and performing a thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews. Methods: Specific methods used to generate long lists of potential core outcomes were evaluated. Results: Different methodological decisions had a substantial impact on the identification of potential core outcomes. Extracting outcomes from published pre-eclampsia trials was an effective way of identifying 48 maternal, eight fetal, 25 neonatal outcomes, and eight patient-reported outcomes. Limiting the extraction of outcomes to primary outcomes or outcomes commonly reported in pre-eclampsia trials reduced the number and diversity of potential core outcomes identified. Thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews ensured an additional five patient reported outcomes and six outcomes related to future child health were identified.

Social media holds great potential for large scale capture of the public's CPR training experiences and may illuminate barriers to CPR training. While studies have examined Twitter data for behaviors associated with cardiovascular health, no investigation has evaluated Twitter data to understand public perception of CPR training. We characterized Tweet content about CPR training and associated sentiment to better understand barriers associated with CPR training. We hypothesized that negative CPR training impressions would be identifiable as barriers to CPR training attainment. Methods: We extracted Tweets from 2011 to 2015 originating in Pennsylvania including the keyword CPR (n = 8419). A random subset of 1000 tweets was independently coded by two authors using grounded theory (mean kappa = 0.74). CPR training Tweets were analyzed for subtopic and sentiment (\\x93positive\\x94 or \\x93negative\\x94). Descriptive statistics were used; a chi squared test was used to examine differences in positive and negative responses. Results: Of 8419 Tweets, CPR training was the most frequent queried result (16%). Within the coded 1000 subset, 18% referenced a CPR training experience. Upcoming CPR training (22%), CPR training curriculum (17%), job-related training (12%), and duration of training (10%) were the most discussed topics regarding CPR training experiences. Of those, the majority of CPR training experiences were negative (53% vs. 47%, p < 0.01) and barriers to CPR training emerged as the primary source of negative experiences. Conclusions: CPR training is the most referenced theme in CPR Tweets from Pennsylvania, and tweets were predominately negative, particularly referencing barriers such as time, location, and duration. Social media is useful for tracking barriers to CPR training attainment and future CPR education modalities.\",\n",
       "  \"(0.717)  Objective To understand general practice (GP) residents' attitudes about their residency training in China. Design Mixed methods survey administered cross-sectionally. Setting Two GP training programmes similar in most regards according to current GP training policy of 5 years' undergraduate degree in medicine and 3 years of postgraduate GP residency training - but differing as the Beijing programme has adopted educational innovations beyond the nationally prescribed standard curriculum used by the second Shenzhen programme. Participants 105 (85%) of eligible GP trainees, 35 (90%) in the innovative Beijing programme and 70 (83%) in the standard training Shenzhen programme. Results Overall, residents felt discrimination because of specialty choice, and that they lacked competency as a general practitioner. Many residents commented faculty had negative teaching attitudes. Beijing residents were more satisfied than Shenzhen residents with their training (p=0.001), and felt teaching faculty had sufficient knowledge (p<0.001), and appropriate attitudes towards teaching (p=0.004). Beijing residents more strongly agreed on five items about good future job prospects (all p<0.05). Conclusion These Chinese GP residents identify areas for improvement in their training as well as strengths. Higher satisfaction with faculty teaching and job optimism in Beijing where GP residents receive training from specifically qualified faculty, and can earn special certification, suggest that the educational innovations enhance training and promote positivity about job prospects. These findings imply that GP residents in China face many training challenges that are similar to other international reports, while also implicating benefits of using an innovative curricular approach.\",\n",
       "  '(0.714)  Humans and pigeons were trained to discriminate between 2 views of actual 3-D objects or their photographs. They were tested on novel views that were either within the closest rotational distance between the training views (interpolated) or outside of that range (extrapolated). When training views were 60° apart, pigeons, but not humans, recognized novel views of actual objects better than their pictures. Further, both species recognized interpolated views of both stimulus types better than extrapolated views, but a single distinctive geon enhanced recognition of novel views only for humans. When training views were 90° apart, pigeons recognized interpolated views better than extrapolated views with actual objects but not with photographs, Thus, pigeons may represent actual objects differently than their pictures. © 2005 by the American Psychological Association.',\n",
       "  '(0.694)  Emerging research indicates that exercise combined with cognitive training may improve cognitive function in older adults. Typically these programs have incorporated sequential training, where exercise and cognitive training are undertaken separately. However, simultaneous or dual-task training, where cognitive and/or motor training are performed simultaneously with exercise, may offer greater benefits. This review summary provides an overview of the effects of combined simultaneous vs. sequential training on cognitive function in older adults. Based on the available evidence, there are inconsistent findings with regard to the cognitive benefits of sequential training in comparison to cognitive or exercise training alone. In contrast, simultaneous training interventions, particularly multimodal exercise programs in combination with secondary tasks regulated by sensory cues, have significantly improved cognition in both healthy older and clinical populations. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal characteristics of a successful simultaneous training program for optimizing cognitive function in older people.',\n",

Exercise at high altitude provides unique challenges to the athlete and to the sport medicine clinician working with these athletes. These challenges include altitude illness, alterations in training intensity and performance, nutritional and hydration difficulties, and challenges related to the austerity of the environment. Furthermore, many of the strategies that are typically utilized by visitors to altitude may have implications from an anti-doping point of view.This position statement was commissioned and approved by the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine.

       " ['(0.661)  Naturalistic theories of disease appeal to concepts of biological function, and use the notion of dysfunction as the basis of their definitions. Debates in the philosophy of biology demonstrate how attributing functions in organisms and establishing the function-dysfunction distinction is by no means straightforward. This problematization of functional ascription has undermined naturalistic theories and led some authors to abandon the concept of dysfunction, favoring instead definitions based in normative criteria or phenomenological approaches. Although this work has enhanced our understanding of disease and illness, we need not necessarily abandon naturalistic concepts of function and dysfunction in the disease debate. This article attempts to move towards a new naturalistic theory of disease that overcomes the limitations of previous definitions and offers advantages in the clinical setting. Our approach involves a re-evaluation of concepts of biological function employed by naturalistic theories. Drawing on recent insights from the philosophy of biology, we develop a contextual and evaluative account of function that is better suited to clinical medicine and remains consistent with contemporary naturalism. We also show how an updated naturalistic view shares important affinities with normativist and phenomenological positions, suggesting a possibility for consilience in the disease debate.',\n",

Aim: To examine the association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome in Chinese population in Hong Kong. Methods: Randomly selected ethnic Chinese were invited to participate in a telephone survey in 1996. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined as subjects having heartburn and/or acid regurgitation once weekly or more. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome I criteria. The association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome was calculated using a statistical model which allows the odds ratio to be measured. Results: One thousand six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate 62%). The population prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome were 5% and 4%, respectively. Thirteen per cent of subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and 11% with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The OR of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 3 (95% CI: 1.05, 6.27) indicating a positive association between the two diseases. This association occurred predominantly in male subjects [OR = 9.3, (95% CI: 2.3, 26.2)] but not as strong in females [OR = 1.5, (95% CI: 0.3, 4.3)]. Younger subjects were statistically more prone to the two diseases. Conclusions: There is a positive association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and their association occurs predominantly in male subjects. © 2007 The Authors.',\n",
       "  '(0.624)  The change in hypometabolism affects the regional links in the brain network. Here, to understand the underlying brain metabolic network deficits during the early stage and disease evolution of AD (Alzheimer disease), we applied correlation analysis to identify the metabolic connectivity patterns using 18F-FDG PET data for NC (normal control), sMCI (stable MCI), pMCI (progressive MCI) and AD, and explore the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity between anatomically-defined brain regions. Regions extracted from 90 anatomical structures were used to construct the matrix for measuring the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. The brain connectivity patterns from the metabolic network show a decreasing trend of inter- and intra-hemispheric connections for NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD. Connection of temporal to the frontal or occipital regions is a characteristic pattern for conversion of NC to MCI, and the density of links in the parietal-occipital network is a differential pattern between sMCI and pMCI. The reduction pattern of inter and intra-hemispheric brain connectivity in the metabolic network depends on the disease stages, and is with a decreasing trend with respect to disease severity. Both frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital connectivity patterns in the metabolic network using 18F-FDG PET are the key feature for differentiating disease groups in AD.',\n",
       "  '(0.623)  Heart failure and coronary artery disease share many risk factors. Coronary artery disease often pre-dates the development of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A diagnosis of heart failure should be considered in any patient with a history of coronary artery disease who presents with breathlessness, ankle oedema or fatigue. Several therapies, such as renin-angiotensin antagonists and B blockers, have been proven to improve survival in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction but evidence for effectiveness in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is lacking. The management of heart failure and coronary artery disease overlaps considerably but can also be conflicting. Optimal risk factor management is key to preventing progression to heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease. Crown Copyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Knowing that the generation, analysis, and interpretation of empirical materials are processes always conducted within some understanding of what constitutes legitimate inquiry and valid knowledge, she drew inspiration from ethnographical, confessional, critical, and post-modern work to propose a set of dialogical principles for conducting and evaluating a nonfoundational type of research inquiry. This manuscript revisits this venture a number of years later, reflecting on what has changed and what is still missing.

Methods: Adolescents from Minnesota participating in Project EAT (n = 2516) were surveyed in 1999 and 2004. Mixed-model regressions were used to assess secular and longitudinal changes in percentage reporting frequent fast food intake (= 3 times/week) and weekly fast food intake. Results: Between 1999 and 2004, a secular increase in the percent of adolescents of middle (high school-aged) adolescents reporting frequent fast food consumption was observed (females: 18.9% to 27.3%, p < .01, males: 23.6% to 30.2%, p = .06). Longitudinal increases in frequent fast food consumption were seen from early to middle adolescence (females: 15.8% to 27.3%, p < .01, males: 16.8% to 30.2%, p < .01), and among males, from middle to late adolescence (23.6% to 32.0%, p < .01). Conclusions: The secular increase in fast food consumption among middle adolescents suggests that socio-environmental changes between 1999 and 2004 may have contributed to adolescents' fast food intake, while the longitudinal trends indicate the importance of developmental influences on fast food intake. The transition from early to middle adolescence, and for males, from middle into late adolescence, are key periods during which efforts to reduce fast food consumption are needed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

       "  '(0.831)  An high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection was developed to quantify both 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and lycopene in plasma and breast nipple aspirate fluids (NAF). As an example of the utility of this assay, levels in plasma and NAF of 11 women were examined and compared with levels of 8-isoprostane, a commonly used marker of lipid oxidation. Levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and 8-isoprostane were higher in NAF than in plasma, but levels of lycopene were lower in NAF than in plasma. Levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol in plasma and in NAF were significantly correlated with both lycopene and 8-isoprostane levels. This is consistent with the dependence of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol levels on both dietary intakes of lycopene and oxidative stress levels. For the correlations between NAF and plasma, lycopene levels were significantly correlated, whereas 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol levels were not, indicating that levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol in NAF are difficult to predict from plasma levels. The high levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and 8-isoprostane in NAF are consistent with high levels of oxidative stress in the breast.',\n",

       "  '(0.785)  Background: Dietary factors such as folate, vitamin B12, protein, and methionine are important for the excretion of arsenic via one-carbon metabolism in undernourished populations exposed to high levels of arsenic via drinking water. However, the effects of dietary factors on toenail arsenic concentrations in well-nourished populations exposed to relatively low levels of water arsenic are unknown. Methods: As part of a population-based case-control study of skin and bladder cancer from the USA, we evaluated relationships between consumption of dietary factors and arsenic concentrations in toenail clippings. Consumption of each dietary factor was determined from a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used general linear models to examine the associations between toenail arsenic and each dietary factor, taking into account potentially confounding effects. Results: As expected, we found an inverse association between ln-transformed toenail arsenic and consumption of vitamin B12 (excluding supplements) and animal protein. Unexpectedly, there were also inverse associations with numerous dietary lipids (e.g., total fat, total animal fat, total vegetable fat, total monounsaturated fat, total polyunsaturated fat, and total saturated fat). Finally, increased toenail arsenic concentrations were associated with increased consumption of long chain n-3 fatty acids. Conclusion: In a relatively well-nourished population exposed to relatively low levels of arsenic via water, consumption of certain dietary lipids may decrease toenail arsenic concentration, while long chain n-3 fatty acids may increase toenail arsenic concentration, possibly due to their association with arsenolipids in fish tissue. © 2012 Gruber et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.',\n",

We selected children 2- to 18-y-old (n = 31,337) from 4 nationally representative surveys of food intake between 1977-1978 and 2003-2006. We assessed portion sizes (kcal and g) of selected key foods (soft/fruit drinks, salty snacks, desserts, French fries, burgers, pizzas, Mexican fast foods, and hot dogs), the total energy from eating occasions that included key foods, and portion sizes of the selected key foods by source (stores, restaurants, and fast-food locations). These foods represented over one-third of children's energy intake in 2003-2006. Portion sizes increased significantly over the 30-y period and increases in pizza were particularly pronounced in the last decade [+176 kcal (736 kJ). Energy from eating occasions including pizzas and soft drinks increased, as did the proportion of energy from these foods in an eating occasion. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers increased in portion size and eating occasion size, but the proportion of these foods in the total eating occasions did not increase. Portion sizes of other key foods increased, although the total energy from eating events that included them remained constant (e.g. Mexican fast-foods, French fries, fruit drinks) or decreased (e.g. salty snacks, desserts). Portion sizes increased across all food sources (stores, restaurants, and fast foods) for soft drinks and pizzas but only at fast-food locations for French fries.

We used HR-pQCT (XtremeCT, Scanco Medical, Geneva, Switzerland) to assess total bone area (ToA), total bone density (ToD), trabecular bone density (TrD), cortical bone density (CoD), cortical thickness (Cort.Th), trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), trabecular spacing standard deviation (Tb.Sp SD), and bone strength index (BSI, mg2/mm4) at the distal tibia in 133 females and 146 males (15 to 20 years of age). We used a general linear model to determine differences by age- and sex-group and age x sex interactions (p<0.05). Across age categories, ToD, CoD, Cort.Th, and BSI were significantly lower at 15 and 16 years compared with 17 to 18 and 19 to 20 years in males and females. There were no differences in ToA, TrD, and BV/TV across age for either sex. Between sexes, males had significantly greater ToA, TrD, Cort.Th, BV/TV, Tb.N, and BSI compared with females; CoD and Tb.Sp SD were significantly greater for females in every age category. Males' larger and denser bones confer a bone-strength advantage from a young age compared with females.

Methods: At baseline, we measured toenail concentrations of 16 metals for 903 premenopausal women in the Sister Study (2003-2009). Age at menopause was ascertained through follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between individual metals and age at menopause. We used quantile-g-computation to examine the association between age at menopause and the joint effect of a simultaneous increase in (1) all metals and for subgroups of metals categorized as (2) essential or (3) non-essential. Results: For individual metals, we observed negligible associations except for an interquartile range increase in lead which was modestly associated with an earlier age at menopause (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05). In the mixture analyses, a quartile increase in all metals was associated with a later age at menopause (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.02). The metals with the largest negative contributions (i.e., associated with a later age at menopause) were chromium and nickel.

Prior evaluations of 2D CT/MR images are limited by the frequent elliptical shape of the PV ostia, the nonorthogonal orientation of the PVs to the left atrial (LA) chamber, and difficulty in appreciating through-slice curvature. To provide anatomical data relevant to balloon catheter ablation, 3D surface reconstructions of LA-PVs were generated and analyzed to define ostial architecture and size. Methods and Results: Using MRI datasets obtained from 101 paroxysmal AF patients, the LA-PVs were segmented to generate 3D LA-PV surface reconstructions. Using both external and endoluminal projections, the PV ostial and antral regions were identified and evaluated. In the left PVs, a common left-sided ostium was identified in 94 patients, with an ostial circumference of 95 ± 15 mm. Branching of the left PVs occurred 0-5 mm away from the common left ostium in 43 patients (43%), 5-15 mm away from the common os in 37 patients (37%), and >15 mm away from the common os in 14 patients (14%). In patients with either distinct left PV ostia, or common os <15 mm (87 patients), the individual LSPV/LIPV ostial circumferences were 67 ± 12 mm and 58 ± 9 mm, respectively. Mean left antral circumference was 114 ± 17 mm. In the right PVs, the ostial circumferences of the RSPV/RIPV were 68 ± 11 mm and 66 ± 11 mm, respectively. Mean right antral circumference was 107 ± 19 mm. Assuming ideal deformation of the LA chamber anatomy, the minimal diameters of a balloon ablation catheter required to isolate 95% of the RSPV, RIPV, LSPV, LIPV, LCPV, left antrum, and right antrum are 29 mm, 28 mm, 29 mm, 24 mm, 40 mm, 46 mm, and 47 mm, respectively.

Patients and methods: The caregivers of 30 patients with FTLD (20 with FTD, 10 with SD) and 26 matched patients with AD were interviewed on potential alterations in driving ability using a standardized questionnaire. Results: Of the patients 90% with FTLD and 58% with AD showed changes in driving behavior. In AD the predominating alteration was an unsteady style of driving with increased lack of orientation. Patients with FTLD presented an aggressive and risky style of driving including various traffic rule violations. Significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding speeding, disregarding red traffic lights, inappropriate behavior and driving despite being forbidden by the family Of the patients with FTLD 37% were responsible for at least one accident since disease onset in comparison to 19% of patients with AD (p=0.24). Most patients with AD showed a reasonable attitude to their change in driving behavior, however the majority of patients with FTLD showed a lack of understanding for the fact that their style of driving presented a potential risk and did not accept the need to stop driving (p=0.023). Conclusion: Patients with FTLD should cease driving as soon as possible in the course of the disease. With patients suffering from mild AD an individual assessment should be made. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.\",\n",

We studied the overall mortality in CRC patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-IBD-CRC patients. Data on all CRC and IBD patients diagnosed with CRC between 1977 and 2009 were retrieved from Danish medical registries. One-year and 5-year overall mortality were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and with Cox regression, adjusting for year of CRC diagnosis, sex, Duke's stage, age at CRC diagnosis, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. We identified 653 CRC patients diagnosed with UC, 238 patients with CD, and 107,024 CRC patients without IBD. The patients with IBD were younger at diagnosis than patients without IBD. The Duke's stage distribution was similar for UC-CRC patients and non-IBD-CRC patients. The CD-CRC patients had a lower frequency of Duke's A and B stage tumors (36% versus 42%), a higher frequency of Duke's C stage tumors (31% versus 27%) and Duke's D-stage tumors (23% versus 21%), and a similar frequency of unknown stage tumors (10%) compared with non-IBD-CRC patients. After 5-years of follow-up, 59% of the UC and the non-UC-CRC patients had died compared with 62% of the patients with CD and 56% of the non-CD-CRC patients. The 5-year adjusted mortality rate ratios for patients with UC or CD were 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.27) and 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.49), respectively, compared with patients without IBD.

We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. Methods: Electronic databases were searched in November 2016. Fourteen studies totaling 911 BC patients on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or tamoxifen (TAM) and 911 controls (i.e., non-cancer controls and BC controls not using ET) were included. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into six domains. Effect sizes were computed to compare (1) ET patients versus controls and (2) TAM patients versus AI patients. Results: In cross-sectional comparisons, ET patients performed worse than control groups on verbal learning/memory, visual learning/memory, frontal executive function, and processing speed, but did not differ on psychomotor efficiency or visuospatial function. Subgroup analyses revealed that verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls. In other domains, ET patients and BC controls performed equivalently. Regarding change from pre-treatment performance, ET patients did not differ from controls on any domain. TAM and AI patients did not from one another differ overall; however, subgroup analyses indicated that TAM patients performed better than non-steroidal AI patients on several domains, but showed few performance differences relative to steroidal AI patients. Conclusions: Verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls, suggesting specific adverse effects on this domain. Additional studies assessing change from pre-treatment performance and differences between steroidal and non-steroidal AIs are warranted.'],\n",
       " ['(0.63)  Even the highest quality evidence will have little impact unless it is incorporated into decision-making for health. It is therefore critical to overcome the many barriers to using evidence in decision-making, including (1) missing the window of opportunity, (2) knowledge gaps and uncertainty, (3) controversy, irrelevant and conflicting evidence, as well as (4) vested interests and conflicts of interest. While this is certainly not a comprehensive list, it covers a number of main themes discussed in the knowledge translation literature on this topic, and better understanding these barriers can help readers of the evidence to be more savvy knowledge users and help researchers overcome challenges to getting their evidence into practice. Thus, the first step in being able to use research evidence for improving population health is ensuring that the evidence is available at the right time and in the right format and language so that knowledge users can take the evidence into consideration alongside a multitude of other factors that also influence decision-making. The sheer volume of scientific publications makes it difficult to find the evidence that can actually help inform decisions for health. Policymakers, especially in low- and middle-income countries, require context-specific evidence to ensure local relevance. Knowledge synthesis and dissemination of policy-relevant local evidence is important, but it is still not enough. There are times when the interpretation of the evidence leads to various controversies and disagreements, which act as barriers to the uptake of evidence. Research evidence can also be influenced and misused for various aims and agendas. It is therefore important to ensure that any new evidence comes from reliable sources and is interpreted in light of the overall body of scientific literature. It is not enough to simply produce evidence, nor even to synthesize and package evidence into a more user-friendly format. Particularly at the policy level, political savvy is also needed to ensure that vested interests do not undermine decisions that can impact the health of individuals and populations.',\n",
       "  '(0.558)  Evidence-based decision-making is centred on the justification of decisions. In the shift from an individual-clinical to a population-policy level, the decision-making context becomes more uncertain, variable and complex. To address this we have developed a conceptual framework for evidence-based decision-making, focusing on how context impacts on what constitutes evidence and how that evidence is utilised. We present two distinct orientations towards what constitutes evidence, representing different relationships between evidence and context. We also categorise the decision-making context based on the ways in which context impacts on evidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, we invoke the concept of axes of evidence-based decision-making to describe the relationship between evidence and context as we move from evidence-based medicine to evidence-based health policy. From this, we suggest that it may be more important how evidence is utilised than how it is defined. Based on the research and knowledge utilisation literature, we present a process model of evidence utilisation, which forms the basis for the conceptual framework for context-based evidence-based decision-making. The conceptual framework attempts to capture the role that context plays in the introduction, interpretation and application of evidence. We illustrate this framework with examples from policy development for colorectal cancer screening. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

The core ideas of evidence-based health care derive from clinical epidemiology and general internal medicine. The concept of evidence has yet to be analysed systematically; what counts as evidence may vary across disciplines. Furthermore, the contribution of the social sciences, particularly qualitative methodology, has received scant attention. This paper outlines a model of evidence that describes four distinct but related types of evidence: qualitative-personal; qualitative-general; quantitative-general and quantitative-personal. The rationale for these distinctions and the implications of these for a theory of evidence are discussed.',\n",

However, it is not entirely clear what it means to base decisions on evidence; debates on evidence-based approaches often lack a clear understanding of the nature of evidence and obscure the normative underpinnings of evidence. Public health decision making requires an acceptance of limitations such as the availability of funding for research to provide complete evidence for any given decision, the ethical constraints on the creation of certain types of evidence and the ongoing dilemma between the need to take action and the need to gather more information. Using the example of the SARS outbreak in Canada, the inter-relationships between evidence and ethics are explored.

Method: We conducted a conceptual analysis to compare definitions and operationalizations of the effect, and reviewed existing evidence to identify potential moderators of the effect. Results: In the psychological literature, we find strong evidence for an undermining effect of tangible rewards on intrinsic motivation for simple tasks when motivation manifest in behavior is initially high. In the economic literature, evidence for undermining effects exists for a broader variety of behaviors, in settings that involve a conflict of interest between parties. By contrast, for health related behaviors, baseline levels of incentivized behaviors are usually low, and only a subset involve an interpersonal conflict of interest. Correspondingly, we find no evidence for crowding out of incentivized health behaviors. Conclusion: The existing evidence does not warrant a priori predictions that an undermining effect would be found for health-related behaviors. Health-related behaviors and incentives schemes differ greatly in moderating characteristics, which should be the focus of future research. © 2013 American Psychological Association.'],\n",

       "  \"(0.604)  Introduction Emergency medicine (EM) has a high case turnover and acuity making it a demanding clinical reasoning domain especially for junior doctors who lack experience. We aimed to better understand their clinical reasoning using dual cognition as a guiding theory. Methods EM junior doctors were recruited from six hospitals in the south of England to participate in semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus groups (n=17) based on recall of two recent cases. Transcripts were analysed using a grounded theory approach to identify themes and to develop a model of junior doctors' clinical reasoning in EM. Results Within cases, clinical reasoning occurred in three phases. In phase 1 (case framing), initial case cues and first impressions were predominantly intuitive, but checked by analytical thought and determined the urgency of clinical assessment. In phase 2 (evolving reasoning), non-analytical single cue and pattern recognitions were common which were subsequently validated by specific analytical strategies such as use of red flags. In phase 3 (ongoing uncertainty) analytical self-monitoring and reassurance strategies were used to precipitate a decision regarding discharge. Conclusion We found a constant dialectic between intuitive and analytical cognition throughout the reasoning process. Our model of clinical reasoning by EM junior doctors illustrates the specific contextual manifestations of the dual cognition theory. Distinct diagnostic strategies are identified and together these give EM learners and educators a framework and vocabulary for discussion and learning about clinical reasoning.\",\n",

Negative learning environments have been shown to be due to many factors, including the presence of unprofessional behaviors among clinical teachers. Reliable and valid assessments of clinical teacher performance, including professional behaviors, may provide a foundation for evidence-based feedback to clinical teachers, enable targeted remediation or recognition, and help to improve the learning environment. However, few tools exist for the evaluation of clinical teachers that include a focus on both professional and clinical teaching behaviors. The Professionalism Assessment of Clinical Teachers (PACT) was developed and implemented at one Canadian institution and was assessed for evidence of reliability and validity. Following each clerkship rotation, students in the 2009-2010 third-year undergraduate clerkship cohort (n = 178) anonymously evaluated a minimum of two clinical teachers using the PACT. 4,715 forms on 567 faculty members were completed. Reliability, validity, and free text comments (present in 45 % of the forms) were examined. An average of 8.6 PACT forms were completed per faculty (range 1-60), with a reliability of 0.31 for 2.9 forms (harmonic mean); 12 forms were necessary for a reliability of 0.65. Global evaluations of teachers aligned with ratings of free-text comments (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). Comment length related negatively with overall rating (r = -0.19, p < 0.001). Mean performance related negatively with variability of performance (r = -0.72, p < 0.001), although this may be related to a ceiling effect. Most faculty members were rated highly; however 'provided constructive feedback' was the least well-rated item. Respectful interactions with students appeared to be the most influential item in the global rating of faculty performance.

The Mapping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards (MAPS) statement was published in 2015 to improve reporting of mapping studies. We aimed to update the systematic review and assess the extent to which recently-published studies mapping condition-specific quality of life or clinical measures to the EQ-5D follow the guidelines published in the MAPS Reporting Statement. Methods: A published systematic review was updated using the original inclusion criteria to include studies published by December 2016. We included studies reporting novel algorithms mapping from any clinical measure or patient-reported quality of life measure to either the EQ-5D-3L or EQ-5D-5L. Titles and abstracts of all identified studies and the full text of papers published in 2016 were assessed against the MAPS checklist. Results: The systematic review identified 144 mapping studies reporting 190 algorithms mapping from 110 different source instruments to EQ-5D. Of the 17 studies published in 2016, nine (53%) had titles that followed the MAPS statement guidance, although only two (12%) had abstracts that fully addressed all MAPS items. When the full text of these papers was assessed against the complete MAPS checklist, only two studies (12%) were found to fulfil or partly fulfil all criteria. Of the 141 papers (across all years) that included abstracts, the items on the MAPS statement checklist that were fulfilled by the largest number of studies comprised having a structured abstract (95%) and describing target instruments (91%) and source instruments (88%). Conclusions: The number of published mapping studies continues to increase. Our updated database provides a convenient way to identify mapping studies for use in cost-utility analysis.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandates that calorie labels be added to menu boards of chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. This systematic review includes seven studies published since the last review on the topic in 2008. Authors searched for peer-reviewed studies using PUBMED and Google Scholar. Included studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design comparing a calorie-labeled menu with a no-calorie menu and were conducted in laboratories, college cafeterias, and fast food restaurants. Two of the included studies were judged to be of good quality, and five of were judged to be of fair quality. Observational studies conducted in cities after implementation of calorie labeling were imprecise in their measure of the isolated effects of calorie labels. Experimental studies conducted in laboratory settings were difficult to generalize to real world behavior. Only two of the seven studies reported a statistically significant reduction in calories purchased among consumers using calorie-labeled menus. The current evidence suggests that calorie labeling does not have the intended effect of decreasing calorie purchasing or consumption. © 2011 Swartz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.',\n",

To make the process of identifying relevant empirical studies for such reviews more efficient, we developed a mixed filter that included different keywords and subject headings for quantitative (e.g., cohort study), qualitative (e.g., focus group), and mixed methods studies. It was tested for six journals from three disciplines. We measured precision (proportion of retrieved documents being relevant), sensitivity (proportion of relevant documents retrieved), and specificity (proportion of non-relevant documents not retrieved). Records were coded before applying the filter and compared with retrieved records, and descriptive statistics were performed, suggesting the mixed filter has high sensitivity, but lower precision and specificity (close to 50%). Next, based on the success of the filter, we developed an automated text classification system that can automatically select empirical studies in order to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews. Several algorithms were trained and validated with 8,050 database records that were previously manually categorized. Decision trees had the best results and surpassed the accuracy of the filter by 30% when using full-text documents.

Method: In the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries confidential enquiry, a sample (13%) of cases was subjected to case note review by multidisciplinary panels attempting to identify avoidable factors associated with the deaths. Cases were selected blindly but in equal numbers from predetermined age bands and participating regions. The anonymised records were reviewed in regions remote to where the child lived and died. Panel composition, conduct and reporting were standardised. Results: 119 of 126 cases reviewed by enquiry panels had sufficient information to determine avoidable factors. These cases were comparable with the whole dataset in terms of sex and causes of death. 31 (26%) of 119 had avoidable factors that were predominantly related to individuals or agencies with a direct responsibility to the child. 51 (43%) of 119 were defined as potentially avoidable. In all, 130 factors were considered in relation to these 82 cases, and 64% of the factors were healthcare related. Avoidable factors were more likely where life-limiting illness was not present.

Because TTT can be associated with more medication switches, concerns arise regarding whether implementing TTT may increase adverse events and/or resource use. The aim of this study was to examine adverse events and resource use during the preintervention and intervention periods of the TTT intervention trial. Methods: We used data from 6 practices enrolled in an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare adverse events and resource use before (months 19) and during (months 1018) a TTT intervention. The outcomes of interest, adverse events and resource use, were based on medical record review of all rheumatology visits for RA patients before and during the intervention. Results: We examined records for 321 patients before the intervention and 315 during the intervention. An adverse event was recorded in 10.2% of visits before the intervention and 8.8% of visits during the intervention (P = 0.41). Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were taken by 53.6% of patients before the intervention and 49.8% of patients during the intervention (P = 0.73). Rheumatology visits were more frequent before the intervention (mean ± SD 4.0 ± 1.4) than during the intervention (mean ± SD 3.6 ± 1.2; P = 0.02). More visits were accompanied by monitoring laboratory tests before the intervention (90.0%) compared with during the intervention (52.7%; P < 0.001). A greater percentage of visits before the intervention included diagnostic imaging (15.4%) versus during the intervention (8.9%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: We observed similar rates of adverse events before and during the implementation of TTT for RA. Rheumatology visits, use of laboratory monitoring, and diagnostic imaging did not increase during the TTT intervention.\t\t\n",

Intervention managers received a facilitated e-learning programme on work-related stress. Main outcomes were Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 12-item GHQ and sickness absence <21 days from human resources. 35 in-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, managers and employees, and additional observational data collected. Results: 424 of 649 (65%) employees approached consented, of whom 350 provided WEMWBS at baseline and 284 at follow-up; 41 managers out of 49 were recruited from the three intervention clusters and 21 adhered to the intervention. WEMWBS scores fell from 50.4-49.0 in the control (n=59) and 51.0-49.9 in the intervention (n=225), giving an intervention effect of 0.5 (95% CI-3.2 to 4.2). 120/225 intervention employees had a manager who was adherent to the intervention. HR data on sickness absence (n=393) showed no evidence of effect. There were no effects on GHQ score or work characteristics. Online quiz knowledge scores increased across the study in adherent managers. Qualitative data provided a rich picture of the context within which the intervention took place and managers' and employees' experiences of it. Conclusions: A small benefit from the intervention on well-being was explained by the mixed methods approach, implicating a low intervention uptake by managers and suggesting that education alone may be insufficient. A full trial of the guided e-learning intervention and economic evaluation is feasible. Future research should include more active encouragement of manager motivation, reflection and behaviour change. Trial Registration number: ISRCTN58661009.\t\t\n",
      "(0.728)  This study describes the development and usage of a Web-based component of a nutrition and physical activity behavioral intervention to promote bone health among preadolescent girls. Thirty Girl Scout troops were randomized to either an intervention or control group for a 2-year period. Girls in the intervention troops (aged 10 to 12 years, N=194) were exposed to grade-specific Web sites that were developed to reinforce the content of the broader, face-to-face intervention. In 5th grade, 82% of the girls logged on once and 48% logged on more than once, compared to 56% and 23% of 6th graders, respectively. Results suggest that although Web-site usage decreased over time, a Web-site program may be useful as a component of a face-to-face, multicomponent intervention. More research is needed to determine ways to enhance and maintain Web-site use over time among youth in health-behavior intervention programs.

Study Design Women presenting for surgical abortion who had chosen the transdermal patch for contraception were randomized to either delayed start of the patch (beginning the Sunday after their abortion) or immediate start (directly observed application of the patch in the clinic). Subjects were contacted at 2 and 6 months to assess contraceptive use. Results Two hundred ninety-eight women were randomized, and the follow-up rate was 71% at 2 months and 53% at 6 months. Method continuation did not differ by timing of initiation. At 2 months, 71% in the delayed-start group and 74% in the immediate-start group were using the patch [p=.6, with a difference of 3.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-17.2% to +11.2%]. At 6 months, 55% in the delayed-start group and 43% in the immediate-start group were using the patch (p=.13, with a difference of 11.9%, 95% CI=-19.2% to +34%). Conclusion Immediate initiation of the contraceptive patch after surgical abortion was not associated with increased use of patch at 2 or 6 months. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.756)  Purpose: To compare the efficacy of problem-solving therapy (PST) with supportive therapy (ST) to improve targeted vision function (TVF) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design: Single-masked, attention-controlled, randomized clinical trial with outcome assessments at 3 months (main trial endpoint) and 6 months (maintenance effects). Participants: Patients with AMD (n = 241) attending retina practices. Interventions: Whereas PST uses a structured problem-solving approach to reduce vision-related task difficulty, ST is a standardized attention-control treatment. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed TVF, the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire plus Supplement (NEI VFQ), the Activities Inventory (AI), and vision-related quality of life (QoL). Results: There were no between-group differences in TVF scores at 3 (P = 0.47) or 6 (P = 0.62) months. For PST subjects, mean ± standard deviation TVF scores improved from 2.71±0.52 at baseline to 2.18±0.88 at 3 months (P = 0.001) and were 2.18±0.95 at 6 months (change from 3 to 6 months, P = 0.74). For ST subjects, TVF scores improved from 2.73±0.52 at baseline to 2.14±0.96 at 3 months (P = 0.001) and were 2.15±0.96 at 6 months (change from 3 to 6 months, P = 0.85). Similar proportions of PST and ST subjects had less difficulty performing a TVF goal at 3 months (77.4% vs 78.6%, respectively; P = 0.83) and 6 months (76.2% vs 79.1%, respectively; P = 0.61). There were no changes in the NEI VFQ or AI. Vision-related QoL improved for PST relative to ST subjects at 3 months (F(4, 192) = 2.46; P = 0.05) and at 6 months (F(4, 178) = 2.55; P = 0.05). The PST subjects also developed more adaptive coping strategies than ST subjects. Conclusions: We found that PST was not superior to ST at improving vision function in patients with AMD, but that PST improved their vision-related QoL. Despite the benefits of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments, AMD remains associated with disability, depression, and diminished QoL. This clinical reality necessitates new rehabilitative interventions to improve the vision function and QoL of older persons with AMD. © 2013 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Published by Elsevier Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.723)  A preliminary cross-sectional study of 72 Hong Kong Chinese infants suggested that these infants learn to roll from supine-to-prone before rolling from prone-to-supine i.e. the opposite to teaching in most western texts. Three-hundred and sixty mothers were recruited postpartum and asked to record, on a chart, information related to the developmental milestone of rolling over for their infants (49% male) during the next 9 months. Telephone reminders were given at 4 and 8 months and, by the end of the study, information had been obtained from 240 mothers (67% of original sample, 51% male infants). Mean ages of rolling over were 5.1 months (SD1.5) for supine-to-prone and 5.7 months (SD1.3) for prone-to-supine. Age of rolling over from supine-to-prone was not influenced by usual sleep position, infant's sex, mother's intention to breastfeed infant, number of siblings, marital status, main daytime caregiver, or feeding method over 9 months.

      "(0.673)  Purpose: This study evaluated whether e-cigarette trial among Mexican adolescents increased the likelihood of trial and use of conventional cigarettes or marijuana use at follow-up. Method: A school-based longitudinal survey was conducted in 60 public middle schools from the three largest cities in Mexico. Students (1213 years old) were surveyed in 2015 and followed up 20 months later (n = 6574). Generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate the association between e-cigarette trial at baseline and conventional cigarettes smoking and marijuana use at follow-up. Result: Adolescents who had tried e-cigarettes (but not cigarettes) at baseline were more likely to have tried conventional cigarettes at followup compared to adolescents who had tried neither e-cigarettes nor cigarettes (43% vs. 24%, respectively; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.70). We also found that adolescents who had tried both conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes at baseline were more likely to have tried marijuana at follow-up compared to adolescents who had tried neither tobacco product (20% vs. 4%, respectively; RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.784.02). Trial of only e-cigarettes was not independently associated with marijuana use at followup. Conclusions: Adolescents who had tried e-cigarettes were more likely to have tried conventional cigarettes and marijuana 20 months later. Although e-cigarettes have been banned in Mexico, it is likely that additional policies and public health campaigns are needed to reduce adolescent use of e-cigarettes and its consequences.\t\t\n",
      "(0.663)  Background and aims: Serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y meningococcal (MenACWY) conjugate vaccines are recommended for routine adolescent immunisation in the United States and Canada. We evaluated the persistence of bactericidal antibodies through early childhood, following infant immunisation with varying schedules of MenACWY-CRM 197 vaccine. Methods: UK and Canadian infants were immunised with 2-3 doses of MenACWY-CRM 197 or 2 doses of serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) conjugate vaccine, and either MenACWY-CRM 197, 1/5 dose of MenACWY polysaccharide vaccine or no booster at 12 months. Control groups recruited at 60 months had received country-specific infant doses of MenC conjugate vaccine. hSBA titres were measured in participants at 40 and 60 months of age. Results: 382 children were enrolled in 12 groups (22-40 per group). By age 60 months, 3-11% of children primed and boosted with MenACWY-CRM 197 had hSBA titres=1:8 against serogroup A, 14-45% against serogroup C, 57-85% against serogroup W-135 and 42-71% against serogroup Y. Children primed with MenC and boosted with MenACWY-CRM 197 had similar results, except for serogroup C (59%). In age-matched controls administered MenC vaccine at 2, 3, and 4 months (UK), 2 and 12 months or 12 months only (Canada), percentages with hSBA titres=1:8 were 0-3%, 29-53%, 34-36% and 10-29% against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y respectively. Conclusions: Serogroup-specific bactericidal antibody wane following infant immunisation with MenACWY-CRM 197, most markedly against serogroup A. Best persistence against serogroup C is observed with MenC conjugate vaccine priming and MenACWY-CRM 197 at 12 months, compared to schedules using only MenACWY-CRM 197, with the potential for providing broader protection compared to monovalent MenC vaccines alone. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. \n",

      "(0.679)  In 2005, approximately 400,000 people provided primary medical care in the United States. About 300,000 were physicians, and another 100,000 were nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Yet primary care faces a growing crisis, in part because increasing numbers of U.S. medical graduates are avoiding careers in adult primary care. Sixty-five million Americans live in what are officially deemed primary care shortage areas, and adults throughout the United States face difficulty obtaining prompt access to primary care. A variety of strategies are being tried to improve primary care access, even without a large increase in the primary care workforce. ©2010 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.674)  Background: Physician assistants (PAs) are often suggested as a partial solution to predicted primary care workforce shortages, but a declining proportion of PAs are entering primary care practice. Policy efforts have focused on increasing primary care PA supply, but low labor market demand might be constricting the primary care PA pipeline. Method: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we compare primary care and specialty job postings to each other and to occupied PA positions. Job posting data for 2014 are from a leading labor analytics firm. Results: Only 18% of job postings were in primary care, compared with 27% of occupied PA positions. The proportion of postings that were for primary care varied widely by state (9% to 40%) and were highest in the West. Discussion: Job availability is a potential barrier to PAs practicing in primary care, especially in some locations. Other job factors are examined and policy solutions are suggested.\t\t\n",
      "(0.654)  Objective To develop a composite measure of primary care quality and apply it to Haitis primary care system. Methods Using the Primary Health Care Performance Initiatives framework, we defined four domains of primary care service delivery: (i) accessible care; (ii) effective service delivery; (iii) management and organization; and (iv) primary care functions. We gave each primary care facility in Haiti a quality score for each domain and overall, with poor, fair and good quality indicated by scores of 0.000.49, 0.500.74 and 0.751.00, respectively. We quantified access and effective access to primary care as the proportions of the population within 5 km of any primary care facility and a good facility, respectively. Findings Of the 786 primary care facilities in Haiti in 2013, only 332 (43%) facilities were classified as good for accessible care. Fewer facilities were classified as good in the domains of effective service delivery (30; 4%), management and organization (91; 12%) and primary care functions (43; 5%). Although about 91% of the population lived within 5 km of a primary care facility, only an estimated 23% of the entire population  including just 5% of the rural population  had access to primary care of good quality. Conclusion Despite an extensive network of health facilities, a minority of Haitians had access to a primary care facility of good quality. Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas. Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems.\t\t\n",
      "(0.643)  Objective: To compare the volume and quality of original research in primary care published by researchers from primary care in the United Kingdom against five countries with well established academic primary care. Design: Bibliometric analysis. Setting: United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands. Studies reviewed: Research publications relevant to comprehensive primary care and authored by researchers from primary care, recorded in Medline and Embase, with publication dates 2001-7 inclusive. Main outcome measures: Volume of published activity of generalist primary care researchers and the quality of the research output by those publishing the most using citation metrics: numbers of cited papers, proportion of cited papers, and mean citation scores. Results: 82 169 papers published between 2001 and 2007 in the six countries were classified as research on primary care. In a 15% pragmatic random sample of these records, 40% of research on primary care from the United Kingdom and 46% from the Netherlands was authored by researchers employed in a primary care setting or employed in academic departments of primary care. The 141 researchers with the highest volume of publications reporting research findings published between 2001 and 2007 (inclusive) authored or part authored 8.3% of the total sample of papers. For authors with the highest proportion of publications cited at least five times, the best performers came from the United States (n=5), United Kingdom (n=4), and the Netherlands (n=2). In the top 10 of authors with the highest proportions of publications achieving 20 or more citations, six were from the United Kingdom and four from the United States. The mean Hirsch index (measure of a researcher's productivity and impact of the published work) was 14 for the Netherlands, 13 for the United Kingdom, 12 for the United States, 7 for Canada, 4 for Australia, and 3 for Germany. Conclusion: This international comparison of the volume and citation rates of papers by researchers from primary care consistently placed UK researchers among the best performers internationally. \n",

      "(0.778)  Summary: The use of sodium bisulfite (BS) treatment followed by hybridization to an Illumina Infinium BeadChip (HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC) is a common method for interrogating 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at single nucleotide resolution. However, standard treatment of DNA with BS does not allow disambiguation of 5mC from an additional cytosine modification, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Recently, it has been demonstrated that paired BS and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) treatment on the same sample followed by hybridization to an Infinium microarray permits the differentiation of 5hmC from 5mC. Nevertheless, estimation of 5hmC and 5mC from tandem-treated arrays has been shown to produce irregular estimates of cytosine modifications. Results: We present a novel method using maximum likelihood estimation to accurately estimate the parameters of unmethylated cytosine (5C), 5mC and 5hmC from Infinium microarray data given the signal intensities from the oxBS and BS replicates.\t\t\n",
      "(0.753)  A lack of strategy to counteract hypoxia (pO2 < 1015 mmHg) and technique to repeatedly measure tumor pO2 has restricted therapeutic optimization. We report the results obtained with an innovative anti-angiogenic strategy of recurrent low-dose (metronomic) chemotherapy to modulate hypoxia and growth of the Head and Neck tumor xenografts. The FaDu tumors were established in the fl ank of immune defi cient mice and EPR oximetry with lithium phthalocyanine crystals was used to follow the temporal changes in tumor pO2 on treatment with gemcitabine including controls for three weeks. The FaDu tumors were hypoxic with a baseline (pre-treatment) pO2 of 28 mmHg. A transient increase in the tumor pO2 was evident on day 3 on treatment with a conventional schedule of gemcitabine (150 mg/kg, d1, d8, d15). No signifi cant change in the tumor pO2 on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine (25 mg/kg on d1, d3, d5 for 3 weeks) was observed. However, tumor pO2 increased signifi cantly on d15d18 during treatment with a metronomic schedule of 15 mg/kg gemcitabine (d1, d3, d5 for 3 weeks). A modest decrease in the tumor growth was evident on treatment with conventional gemcitabine. Notably, tumor growth was signifi cantly inhibited by metronomic (25 and 15 mg/kg) gemcitabine treatment. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of the tumor samples indicate a decrease in HIF-1a and TSP-1 on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine. In conclusion, a signifi cant inhibition of tumor growth on treatment with metronomic gemcitabine was observed; however, the increase in pO2 was dose dependent. EPR oximetry can be used to follow the temporal changes in tumor pO2 to identify a therapeutic window on treatment with metronomic chemotherapy for potential combination with radiotherapy.\t\t\n",

Clinic policy is that patients identified as using cocaine must attend a weekly cocaine-focused, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) group. Cocaine treatment is based on a behavioral (escape) contingency model whereby completers must attend group-counseling sessions and produce cocaine-negative urinalysis results. Among the 113 patients enrolled in the cocaine group, 43 (38%) were treatment completers (who attended 6 consecutive weeks of group and produced 6 consecutive weeks of cocaine-free urine tests) and 70 (62%) were treatment noncompleters. Treatment completion (i.e., cocaine abstinence) was significantly associated with baseline cocaine-free urinalysis and higher methadone dose. © 2009 American Psychological Association.\t\t\n",
      "(0.641)  This study examines how different types of health coverage influence the likelihood of entering treatment for an alcohol problem, and the extent that people in treatment are able to use their insurance to help cover the costs of care. Survey data are analyzed from a sample of problem drinkers drawn from the general population and chemical dependency treatment programs in the same community. We find that, in comparison to being on Medicaid and being uninsured, having private coverage does not significantly alter the odds of treatment entry. Being in a private managed care plan, as compared to traditional indemnity coverage, also does not appear to impact the chances of treatment entry. However, having private coverage, as compared to being on Medicare, doubles the odds of treatment entry. For problem drinkers who obtain treatment, those with private coverage are as or more likely than other insured groups to report that insurance helped to pay treatment expenses. Even so, 10% of those privately insured report having paid for all of their treatment costs out of pocket. We conclude that, while prior studies have rarely found that having insurance significantly impacts alcohol treatment entry, the type of coverage one possesses may matter in some cases. Our results concerning Medicare coverage may point to potential problems with making treatment affordable to some problem drinkers outside the private insurance system. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

      "(0.636)  Metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment is associated with anti-angiogenic activity and is anticipated to generate exploitable hypoxia using hypoxia-activated prodrugs. Weekly administration of tirapazamine (TPZ; 5 mg/kg body weight i.p.) failed to inhibit the growth of 9L gliosarcoma tumors grown s.c. in scid mice. However, the anti-tumor effect of weekly cyclophosphamide (CPA) treatment (140 mg/kg BW i.p.) was substantially enhanced by weekly TPZ administration. An extended tumor free period and increased frequency of tumor eradication without overt toxicity were observed when TPZ was given 3, 4 or 5 days after each weekly CPA treatment. Following the 2nd CPA injection, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Oximetry indicated significant increases in tumor pO2, starting at 48 hr, which further increased after the 3rd CPA injection. pO2 levels were, however, stable in growing untreated tumors. A strong negative correlation (-0.81) between tumor pO2 and tumor volume during 21 days of weekly CPA chemotherapy was observed, indicating increasing tumor pO2 with decreasing tumor volume. Furthermore, CPA treatment resulted in increased tumor uptake of activated CPA. CPA induced increases in VEGF RNA, which reached a maximum on day 1, and in PLGF RNA which was sustained throughout the treatment, while anti-angiogenic host thrombospondin-1 increased dramatically through day 7 post-CPA treatment. Weekly cyclophosphamide treatment was anticipated to generate exploitable hypoxia. However, our findings suggest that weekly CPA treatment induces a functional improvement of tumor vasculature, which is characterized by increased tumor oxygenation and drug uptake in tumors, thus counter-intuitively, benefiting intratumoral activation of TPZ and perhaps other bioreductive drugs. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. \n",

      "(0.65)  This paper shows how the theory of symbolic interactionism shaped a grounded investigation of the organizational labor of Australian Emergency Department (ED) clinicians. Further, it shows how symbolic interactionism supports reflexive criteria for validating grounded research. Using ethnographic methods across two metropolitan EDs, interactionism's emphasis on roles applied equally to the relationship between researcher and participants as to the relationships among participants. Specifically, the researcher generated data by positioning interactionism as the mediator of the emergent relationship between researcher and participants. The results of this positioning were: a traceable path from understanding to interpretation and the search for consequentiality rather than truth. Interactionism facilitated the co-production by the researcher and participants of limits on the generalizability of the data. The paper is an argument for symbolic interactionism as a means not merely to generate sociological findings, but to conceptualize the impact of the researcher on the grounded research process. © 2005-2008 Qualitative Sociology Review.\t\t\n",
      "(0.617)  The Life Story Board (LSB) is a visual tool used in therapeutic circumstances to co-construct a lifescape that represents the personal, relational and temporal aspects of a person's lived experiences. We conducted a study of the drug use and harm reduction experiences of people who inject drugs through research interviews using the LSB to determine whether it has the potential to enhance qualitative research. Our team included community researchers who were current or former drug users and academic researchers. Interviews were conducted by two community researchers: an interviewer and a storyboarder who populated the LSB. Results showed that interviewers and participants interacted with the LSB in different ways. The board functioned to situate the interviewers in the interview schedule, whereas participants often used the board as a way to validate or reinforce their life story. Participants expressed a variety of emotional and cognitive responses to the board. Overall, the LSB helped participants focus on their life story to recall specific occasions or incidents and enabled them to gain perspective and make greater sense of their lives. Both participants and interviewers engaged with the LSB in nuanced ways that enabled them to work together to represent the participant's life story.\t\t\n",
      "(0.595)  Background: The uptake of HIV self-testing (HIVST) could address socio-structural barriers that prevent South African youth from utilizing the testing resources available in their communities. However, to facilitate this, we must tailor components of the HIVST kit and process to ensure that we reach and encourage youth to test. The purpose of this study to elucidate concerns and issues regarding HIVST rollout among South African youth. Methods: This study was conducted in two phases: 1) focus group discussions with rural, South African youth aged 18-24 and 2) direct observations of participants completing with an oral HIVST kit and/or a blood based HIVST kit. In phase 2a participants were invited to try both an oral and blood-based HIVST kit. In phase 2b, participants selected the HIVST kit of their choice. Results: We enrolled 35 unique participants in phase 1, 20 participants in phase 2a, and 40 participants in phase 2b. While the focus group discussions highlighted hypothetical HIVST use only, participants appreciated the privacy that the HIVST could afford them. However, they expressed concerns about whether HIVST could be trusted due to false positives and negatives, as well as whether a person would be able to emotionally handle the results if they tested alone. They suggested that the kits be used alongside someone who could provide support. In phases 2a and 2b, participants were overwhelmingly positive about both kits regarding ease of use and whether their results could be trusted. The participants, however, experienced more challenges with the blood-based versus oral test. When given the choice in phase 2b, most participants (80%) chose the oral HIVST over the blood-based HIVST. Conclusions: During the focus group discussions, participants raised concerns about the validity of HIVST, lack of emotional support when testing alone, and the cost of HIVST kits, all of which could be addressed through current testing campaigns. Most of those who actually tested had positive experiences with HIVST and would recommend it to their friends. When offered a choice, most preferred the oral test.

      "(0.585)  While courtroom examinations are often recognized as a distinct speech-exchange system, little is known about how participants do an examination beyond its unique turn-taking system. This article attempts to shed some light on this issue by studying the question design during the direct examination in an American criminal court case using Conversation Analysis. It shows that attorneys use different question forms compared to casual conversation: declaratives are far less prevalent and questions are often designed as requests for action. In addition, attorneys make use of forms that are not found in other types of interaction, such as the tag (is that) correct. The way in which attorneys design their questions additionally shows that the rules of the courtroom have procedural consequences for how the interaction is done. But these rules have to be enacted, and it is in their violation that participants bring about categories such as leading questions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.555)  Objectives To assess the Threshold Technique's (TT) feasibility in community-wide surveys of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries' preferences for end-of-life (EOL) care options. Study Setting Study participants were community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries in four different regions in the United States. Study Design During personal interviews, participants considered four EOL scenarios, each presenting a choice between a less intense and more intense care option. Data Collection Participants selected their initially favored option. Depending on that choice, in the subsequent TT the length of life offered by the more intense option was systematically increased or decreased until the participant \"switched\" to his or her initially rejected option. Principal Findings Participants were able to select an initially favored option (in 3 of the 4 scenarios; this was the less intense option). The majority of participants were able to engage with the subsequent TT. In all scenarios, regardless of the increase/decrease in the length of life offered by the more intense option, the majority of participants were unwilling to \"switch\" to their initially rejected option. Conclusions In surveys of populations' preferential attitudes toward EOL care options, the TT was a feasible elicitation method, engaging most participants and measuring the strength of their attitudes. Further methodological work is merited, involving (1) populations with various participant characteristics, and (2) different attributes in the TT task itself. © Health Research and Educational Trust. \n",

      "(0.737)  Applying a previously learned concept to a novel problem is an important but difficult process called transfer. Practicing multiple concepts together (mixed practice mode) has been shown superior to practicing concepts separately (blocked practice mode) for transfer. This study examined the effect of single and multiple practice contexts for both mixed and blocked practice modalities on transfer performance. We looked at performance on near transfer (familiar contexts) cases and far transfer (unfamiliar contexts) cases. First year psychology students (n = 42) learned three physiological concepts in a 2 × 2 factorial study (one or two practice contexts and blocked or mixed practice). Each concept was practiced with two clinical cases; practice context was defined as the number of organ systems used (one system per concept vs. two systems). In blocked practice, two practice cases followed each concept; in mixed practice, students learned all concepts before seeing six practice cases. Transfer testing consisted of correctly classifying and explaining 15 clinical cases involving near and far transfer. The outcome was ratings of quality of explanations on a 03 scale. The repeated measures analysis showed a significant near versus far by organ system interaction [F(1,38) = 3.4, p < 0.002] with practice with a single context showing lower far transfer scores than near transfer [0.58 (0.37)0.83 (0.37)] compared to the two contexts which had similar far and near transfer scores [1.19 (0.50)1.01 (0.38)]. Practicing with two organ contexts had a significant benefit for far transfer regardless of mixed or blocked practice; the single context mixed practice group had the lowest far transfer performance; this was a large effect size (Cohens d = 0.81). Using only one practice context during practice significantly lowers performance even with the usually superior mixed practice mode. Novices should be exposed to multiple contexts and mixed practice to facilitate transfer.\t\t\n",

Some of the most successful practices were built up from nothing, and some of the happiest doctors spent time not being doctors. Despite the element that fate plays in career paths it is prudent to make plans-'A career in general practice offers many options for further professional development. While some GPs prefer to concentrate primarily on their practice, others find additional fulfillment in teaching, research or international collaboration. Whichever path you choose, general practice promises a rewarding and exciting experience. This inspiring new book emphasises there is no single career path in general practice. Without being prescriptive, its practical approach helps you make life-changing decisions, prompts self-analysis and equips you with the tools to remain flexible, positive and reflective about your career. 'So-have you got what it takes to practise the 'medicine plus' which is today's general practice? This book, written and edited by colleagues many of whom have far more street cred than I, will help you decide. If you have, I wish you luck, fulfilment, and the gratification that comes from being a catalyst for good in the lives of your fellow human beings. If you have a role teaching and mentoring the next generation of GPs, you will find this book a persuasive ally. But if you decide that hospital medicine is your preferred option - well, that's fine.

      "(0.652)  This chapter explores ethics in qualitative research. It outlines the broad ethical principles that underpin good research and the aspects of ethical practice that qualitative researchers are especially likely to need to consider when designing, conducting, and disseminating their research. The chapter explains ways of thinking about research ethics, beginning with some overarching philosophical principles, before moving on to discuss situational and relational aspects of ethical research practice. Formal codes of ethics, and practice guidelines developed by professional bodies and institutions, highlight three core concerns that researchers working with human subjects should attend to, namely: informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymity. The chapter also outlines how these apply to qualitative research. It also explores ethics associated with doing research. Although the requirements of research ethical review processes described in the chapter can help the researcher avoid many ethical issues in advance, ethical questions and dilemmas can arise during the conduct of a project.\t\t\n",

To quantify how many First5 GPs are currently part of a small group and if they undertake CPD in this format. To investigate how First5 currently fund CPD and how much they would be willing to invest in CPD per year. Methods Online survey of RCGP members who have been on the GP register for less than five years. Results First5 GPs access CPD in a variety of formats. CPD provision around practice management and leadership aimed at GPs in their first five years is currently lacking. Many First5 GPs already belong to a small group but more than half find undertaking CPD in the small group is challenging. Most First5 GPs self fund their educational activity and would like to spend £500 or less per year on CPD. Conclusion Cost-effective CPD tailored to the needs of GPs in their first five years of independent practice and delivered in a variety of formats is lacking in some educational areas.

      "(0.642)  Objectives The aim of the present secondary analysis of data collected in a grounded theory study was to explore the perceptions of Registrars and new Fellows to practice ownership and management. Methods Focus groups and interviews with Registrars and recent Fellows were undertaken to explore the desire to become an owner, facilitators and barriers to practice ownership and delivery models for practice ownership education. A secondary thematic analysis was conducted to understand emerging concepts related to perceptions of general practice ownership. Results A surprisingly strong theme of fear was evident across focus group and interview participants. Expressed fear was specifically related to financial concerns, lack of relevant knowledge and skills and concern over balancing different roles. Moderating factors included previous life and educational experiences, as well as role modelling. Conclusions Graduation of a cohort of new general practitioners (GPs) who express fear towards practice ownership is concerning. Creating more positive learning environments and opportunity for open discussion regarding practice management and ownership is an important step in providing adequate support for new GPs to give serious consideration to career options. What is known about the topic? The traditional model of general practice ownership has been for a doctor to own and/or manage the practice. Fewer new GPs are taking on the role of owning a general practice, and disinterest has been presumed to play a significant role in this trend. It has been reported that current curricula provide insufficient focus on providing learning opportunities for general practice trainees on ownership and management models; however, recent research has shown that general practice trainees have a strong interest in receiving this knowledge during their training. What does this paper add? The present qualitative research evaluated the emotional response that general practice trainees (Registrars) expressed when they considered practice ownership. GP Registrars expressed fear when asked about the prospect of owning their own practice. This may be influenced by the role modelling they receive during their training. What are the implications for practitioners? Supervisors involved in general practice training should ensure their trainees have the opportunity to learn about practice ownership during their training. Supervisors should also be aware that their own behaviour and attitudes towards practice ownership is observed by their trainees and it can colour the emotional response the trainee has when considering owning a practice. \n",

      "(0.6)  Background: The long-term prognostic implication of post-procedural hematocrit drops in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization outside the clinical trial setting is not well defined. Methods: Data was prospectively collected from 12,661 patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization between July 1998 and July 2006. Patients were divided into three cohorts based upon the degree of hematocrit change: drop greater than 6, drop between 3 and 6, and drop less than 3. In-hospital major adverse events, 30-day mortality, and long-term all-cause mortality were recorded. Results: Patients with larger reductions in hematocrit were more likely to be older, female, and have a higher baseline hematocrit, present with acute myocardial infarction, develop cardiogenic shock, require emergent catheterization, develop retroperitoneal bleeds and large hematomas, receive transfusions, have longer index hospitalizations, develop subacute stent thrombosis, and have higher 30-day and long-term mortality. An increase in long-term mortality was observed with progressive hematocrit drop. This finding is largely driven by early (30 day) mortality, as trends were no longer significant after rezeroing mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were identified as independent predictors of near and long-term mortality. Conclusions: Periprocedural bleeding, defined by hematocrit drop, is associated with increased near-term and long-term mortality in patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization procedures. Long-term mortality is largely driven by up front 30-day mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent predictor for near-term mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were independent predictors for near and long-term mortality. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.586)  Objectives Late survival is similar after open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR), despite a perioperative benefit with EVAR. AAA-related reinterventions are more common after EVAR, whereas laparotomy-related reinterventions are more common after open repair. The effect of reinterventions on survival, however, is unknown. We therefore evaluated the rate of reinterventions and readmission after initial AAA repair, 30-day mortality, and the effect on long-term survival. Methods We identified AAA-related and laparotomy-related reinterventions for propensity score-matched cohorts of 45,652 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR and open repair from 2001 to 2004. Follow-up was up to 6 years. Hospitalizations for ruptured AAA without repair and for bowel obstruction or ventral hernia without abdominal surgery were also recorded. Event rates were calculated per year and are presented through 6 years of follow-up as events per 100 person-years. Thirty-day mortality was calculated for each reintervention or readmission. Results Through 6 years, overall reinterventions or readmissions were similar between repair methods but slightly more common after EVAR (7.6 vs 7.0/100 person-years; relative risk [RR], 1.1; P < .001). Overall 30-day mortality with any reintervention or readmission was 9.1%. EVAR patients had more ruptures (0.50 vs 0.09 [RR, 5.7; P < .001]), with a mortality of 28%, but these were uncommon. EVAR patients also had more AAA-related reinterventions through 6 years (3.7 vs 0.9 [RR, 4.0; P < .001]; mortality, 5.6%), most of which were minor endovascular reinterventions (2.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 11.4; P < .001]), with a 30-day mortality of 3.0%. However, minor open (0.8 vs 0.5 [RR, 1.4; P < .001]; mortality, 6.9%) and major reinterventions (0.4 vs 0.2 [RR, 2.4; P < .001]; mortality, 12.1%) were also more common after EVAR than open repair. Conversely, EVAR patients had fewer laparotomy-related reinterventions than open patients (1.4 vs 3.0 [RR, 0.5; P < .001]; mortality, 8.1%) and readmissions without surgery (2.0 vs 2.7 [RR, 0.7; P < .001]; mortality 10.9%). Overall, reinterventions or readmission accounted for 9.6% of all EVAR deaths and 7.6% of all open repair deaths in the follow-up period (P < .001). Conclusions Reintervention and readmission are slightly higher after EVAR. Survival is negatively affected by reintervention or readmission after EVAR and open surgery, which likely contributes to the erosion of the survival benefit of EVAR over time. © 2011 Society for Vascular Surgery.\t\t\n",
      "(0.567)  Despite experiencing hot weathers, limited studies from India explored relationships between ambient heat and health. We studied associations between heat and all-cause mortality to estimate heat threshold(s) affecting health, and examine other affecting dimensions. We conducted time-series analysis with daily maximum temperature and all-cause mortality data of Bhubaneswar city (MarchJuly, 20072017), and explored their interactions. Mortality risks rose when daily maximum temperatures were >36.2°C (lower threshold), and even more when >40.5°C (upper threshold). Every degree above36.2°C increased the mortality risk by 2% (mortality rate ratio: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01, 1.03). The effects of maximum temperature increased on days when minimum temperatures were >25.6°C (median). The effect of heat was immediate and lasted for 01 day with no lagged effect. Two temperature thresholds with varying mortality risks provided an opportunity for a graded heat warning system. The accentuation of the deleterious effects of heat by the higher minimum temperature calls for its inclusion in the heat warning system in future.\t\t\n",
      "(0.541)  Background. There is no consensus on the optimal period during which to assess death after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Three measures are commonly used: in-hospital, 30-day, and procedural (either in-hospital or 30-day) mortality. We used a regional database to calculate the CABG mortality rate using each of these mortality measures. Methods. Data were collected prospectively on 31,592 consecutive isolated CABG surgeries in northern New England between January 1992 and December 2001. These data were linked to the National Death Index to obtain vital status through December 2001, and used to calculate 30-day and procedural mortality rates. Procedural mortality was defined as death occurring either within the hospital setting or within 30 days of the index procedure. Regional registry data were used to calculate in-hospital mortality rates. Results. Mortality rates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. In all but one medical center, the in-hospital mortality was the lowest rate, while in all centers the procedural mortality rate was the highest. There were 1,082 deaths captured by the procedural mortality measure. Of these, 927 were included in the in-hospital mortality measure; 956 occurred within 30 days of surgery. Conclusions. Each of the measures studied has its advantages and may be used to assess the mortality outcomes of cardiac surgery. The more important issue other than the specific measure used is our ability to measure and validate it conveniently and accurately in actual practice. © 2006 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.\t\t\n",
      "(0.5)  What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks? Background: Following a century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking. Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images. Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing ~68.9% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors. Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age. Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions. \n",

      "(0.62)  Conservation is predominantly an exercise in trying to change human behaviour  whether that of consumers whose choices drive unsustainable resource use, of land managers clearing natural habitats, or of policymakers failing to deliver on environmental commitments. Yet conservation research and practice have made only limited use of recent advances in behavioural science, including more novel behaviour change interventions. Instead conservationists mostly still rely on traditional behaviour change interventions  education, regulation and material incentivisation  largely without applying recent insights from behavioural science about how to improve such approaches. This paper explores how behavioural science could be more widely and powerfully applied in biodiversity conservation. We consider the diverse cast of actors involved in conservation problems and the resulting breadth of behaviour change that conservationists might want to achieve. Drawing on health research, we present a catalogue of types of interventions for changing behaviour, considering both novel, standalone interventions and the enhancement of more traditional conservation interventions. We outline a framework for setting priorities among interventions based on their likely impact, using ideas developed for climate change mitigation. We caution that, despite its promise, behavioural science is not a silver bullet for conservation. The effects of interventions aimed at changing behaviour can be modest, temporary, and context-dependent in ways that are as-yet poorly understood. We therefore close with a call for interventions to be tested and the findings widely disseminated to enable researchers and practitioners to build a much-needed evidence base on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.607)  Much of the global burden of non-communicable disease is caused by unhealthy behaviours that individuals enact even when informed of their health-harming consequences. A key insight is that these behaviours are not predominantly driven by deliberative conscious decisions, but occur directly in response to environmental cues and without necessary representation of their consequences. Consequently, interventions that target non-conscious rather than conscious processes to change health behaviour may have significant potential, but this important premise remains largely untested. This is in part due to the lack of a practicable conceptual framework that can be applied to better describe and assess these interventions. We propose a framework for describing or categorising interventions to change health behaviour by the degree to which their effects may be considered non-conscious. Potential practical issues with applying such a framework are discussed, as are the implications for further research to inform the testing and development of interventions. A pragmatic means of conceptualising interventions targeted at non-conscious processes is a necessary prelude to testing the potency of such interventions. This can ultimately inform the development of interventions with the potential to shape healthier behaviours across populations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.577)  Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a countrys health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions. Results Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 8095) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 9097), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 8493). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen. Conclusion Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.543)  A population-based approach takes account of the needs of the people within a given population. A key aspect of this is reducing unwarranted variation and addressing both the underuse of high-value interventions and the overuse of low-value interventions. In the context of end-of-life care, high-value interventions are those that enhance quality of life. In contrast, low-value interventions are those that are futile, those that negatively impact on quality of life, and those that are not in line with the person's wishes. Advance care planning (ACP) is a means by which a person can document their choices at the end of life; it supports person-centred care and also facilitates the redistribution of investment from low-value to high-value interventions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.534)  Background: \"Nudging\" - modifying environments to change people's behavior, often without their conscious awareness - can improve health, but public acceptability of nudging is largely unknown. Methods: We compared acceptability, in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA), of government interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Three nudge interventions were assessed: i. reducing portion Size, ii. changing the Shape of the drink containers, iii. changing their shelf Location; alongside two traditional interventions: iv. Taxation and v. Education. We also tested the hypothesis that describing interventions as working through non-conscious processes decreases their acceptability. Predictors of acceptability, including perceived intervention effectiveness, were also assessed. Participants (n = 1093 UK and n = 1082 USA) received a description of each of the five interventions which varied, by randomisation, in how the interventions were said to affect behaviour: (a) via conscious processes; (b) via non-conscious processes; or (c) no process stated. Acceptability was derived from responses to three items. Results: Levels of acceptability for four of the five interventions did not differ significantly between the UK and US samples; reducing portion size was less accepted by the US sample. Within each country, Education was rated as most acceptable and Taxation the least, with the three nudge-type interventions rated between these. There was no evidence to support the study hypothesis: i.e. stating that interventions worked via non-conscious processes did not decrease their acceptability in either the UK or US samples. Perceived effectiveness was the strongest predictor of acceptability for all interventions across the two samples. Conclusion: In conclusion, nudge interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages seem similarly acceptable in the UK and USA, being more acceptable than taxation, but less acceptable than education. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that highlighting the non-conscious processes by which nudge interventions may work decreases their acceptability. However, highlighting the effectiveness of all interventions has the potential to increase their acceptability. \n",

      "(0.788)  This research examined the role of movie portrayals of smoking as well as peer, parent, and sibling smoking as predictors of intentions to smoke and smoking behavior in adolescents. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of a model that proposes that identification with smokers, normative beliefs about smoking, and positive expectations about smoking are mediators of the association between social influences and smoking intentions. Our models provided a good fit for both a cross-sectional model of smoking and a model of smoking initiation. The relationship between media exposure to smoking and intentions to smoke was mediated by positive expectancies and identification as a smoker in the cross-sectional model, and by positive expectancies in baseline neversmokers. Our results indicate that viewing smoking in movies is an important predictor of smoking among adolescents and that identity processes and expectancies serve as mediators of this effect.

We examined the relationship between the COMT 1947A>G polymorphism and smoking initiation, smoking persistence and smoking cessation. We genotyped 266 current smokers, 270 ex-smokers and 265 lifetime non-smokers (never smokers), matched for age and gender, for the COMT 1947A>G polymorphism. Smoking status was ascertained by self-report. There was no difference in genotype frequencies between never smokers and ever smokers (current + ex-smokers); between non-smokers (never + ex-smokers) and current smokers; or between current smokers and ex-smokers.

      "(0.764)  BACKGROUND. Several studies have linked seeing smoking in movies with adolescent smoking, but none have determined how much movie smoking adolescents see. OBJECTIVE. Our aim was to determine exposure to movie smoking in a representative sample of young US adolescents. METHODS. We surveyed 6522 nationally representative US adolescents aged 10-14 years. We content analyzed 534 contemporary box-office hits for movie smoking. Each movie was assigned to a random subsample of adolescents (mean: 613) who were asked whether they had seen the movie. Using survey weights, we estimated the total number of US adolescents who had seen each movie and then multiplied by the number of smoking depictions in each movie to obtain gross smoking impressions seen by adolescents. RESULTS. The 534 movies were mainly rated PG-13 (41%) and R (40%), and 74% contained smoking (3830 total smoking occurrences). On average, each movie was seen by 25% of the adolescents surveyed. Viewership was higher with increased age and lower for R-rated movies. Overall, these movies delivered 13.9 billion gross smoking impressions, an average of 665 to each US adolescent aged 10-14 years. Although this sample's R-rated movies contained 60% of smoking occurrences, they delivered only 39% of smoking impressions because of lower adolescent viewership. Thirty popular movies each delivered =100 million gross smoking impressions. Thirty actors each delivered >50 million smoking impressions, such that just 1.5% of actors delivered one quarter of all character smoking to the adolescent sample. CONCLUSIONS. Popular movies deliver billions of smoking images and character smoking depictions to young US adolescents. Removing smoking from youth-rated films would substantially reduce exposure from new box-office hits. Furthermore, the popular actors who frequently smoke in movies could have a major impact on adolescent movie smoking exposure by choosing not to portray characters who smoke.

      "(0.73)  In this paper the utility of the concept of craving in the explanation of smoking behaviour both in abstinence and in the resumption of smoking is explored. The experience of craving is suggested to be one of the foremost symptoms of withdrawal, and a major cause of relapse, and yet there is no standardised tool for measuring craving, neither has any agreement ever been reached concerning the precise meaning of the term. Estimates of the prevalence of craving vary widely. Predictions of craving during abstinence have focused on pre-cessation smoking habits, but evidence implies that high pre-cessation craving leads to high craving during abstinence, and has also suggested that craving can be maintained by smoking. Pharmacological aids used to relieve craving in smoking cessation have not had convincing results, and psychological and motivational aspects and expectancies may also play a part in generating craving. Questions relating to the concept of craving in need of attention in research are highlighted and future directions for research recommended.\t\t\n",
      "(0.722)  Aims: To assess the association between seeing smoking in a movie and adolescent and adult smokers' attitude towards smoking and intention to quit. Methods: Anatural experiment was conducted in a multiplex cinema. We conducted exit interviews with 4,073 movie patrons, of whom 645 (16%) were smokers. Eleven per cent (n = 69) of the smokers were aged 14 to 17 years old. Subjects had exited 26 movies, of which 12 (46%) contained smoking. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear regression to assess the effects of (a) exposure to movie smoking (yes vs. no), and (b) age (adolescent vs. adult smokers) on general attitude towards smoking and intention to quit smoking within the next 6 months (both scales ranged 0-10). Results: Smokers who saw a movie with smoking had more favourable attitudes towards smoking than those seeing a movie without smoking (p = 0.004). A significant interaction between age group and movie smoking indicated that this difference was more pronounced in adolescent smokers (p = 0.035). No significant differences were found for intentions to quit smoking. Conclusions: Study results suggest that smoking in the movies may influence young smokers to have a more favorable attitude towards smoking. © 2012 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG. \n",

      "(0.76)  OBJECTIVE - Assignment of the correct molecular diagnosis in diabetes is necessary for informed decisions regarding treatment and prognosis. Better clinical markers would facilitate discrimination and prioritization for genetic testing between diabetes subtypes. Serum 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) levels were reported to differentiate maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A mutations (HNF1A-MODY) from type 2 diabetes, but this requires further validation. We evaluated serum 1,5AG in a range of diabetes subtypes as an adjunct for defining diabetes etiology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - 1,5AG was measured in U.K. subjects with: HNF1A-MODY (n = 23), MODY due to glucokinase mutations (GCK-MODY, n = 23), type 1 diabetes (n = 29), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA, n = 42), and type 2 diabetes (n = 206). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess discriminative accuracy of 1,5AG for diabetes etiology. RESULTS - Mean (SD range) 1,5AG levels were: GCK-MODY 13.06 µg/ml (5.74-29.74), HNF1A-MODY 4.23 µg/ml (2.12-8.44), type 1 diabetes 3.09 µg/ml (1.45-6.57), LADA 3.46 µg/ml (1.42-8.45), and type 2 diabetes 5.43 (2.12-13.23). Levels in GCK-MODY were higher than in other groups (P < 10-4 vs. each group). HNF1A-MODY subjects showed no difference in unadjusted 1,5AG levels from type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and LADA. Adjusting for A1C revealed a difference between HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001). The discriminative accuracy of unadjusted 1,5AG levels was 0.79 for GCK-MODY versus type 2 diabetes and 0.86 for GCK-MODY versus HNF1A-MODY but was only 0.60 for HNF1A-MODY versus type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS - In our dataset, serum 1,5AG performed well in discriminating GCK-MODY from other diabetes subtypes, particularly HNF1A-MODY. Measurement of 1,5AG levels could inform decisions regarding MODY diagnostic testing. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.\t\t\n",
      "(0.625)  Aim: The purpose of the study was to analyse self-descriptions of diabetes burnout in individuals with Type 1 diabetes via YouTube videos. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study, a systematic approach was used to search YouTube videos with a title, description or content specifically about diabetes burnout dated between 2007 and 2017. Irrelevant or duplicated videos were excluded using eligibility criteria. All videos meeting inclusion criteria (n = 32) from individuals with Type 1 diabetes were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse video characteristics. Results: The four major themes associated with diabetes burnout were: (i) feeling mentally drained and physically tired of dealing with self-care; (ii) experiencing a detachment from self, diabetes care and support system; (iii) being powerless and paralysed to climb out of diabetes burnout; and (iv) contributing potential factors to diabetes burnout. Conclusions: Self-descriptions of diabetes burnout suggest that it is a combination of emotions and behaviours on a spectrum from exhaustion to detachment accompanied by an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. More studies are needed to further clarify diabetes burnout and its distinction from, or overlap with, other related psychosocial concepts in diabetes care.\t\t\n",
      "(0.608)  Aims and objectives. To explore patients' responses to developing and managing cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and to contrast their views with those of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Background. The incidence of diabetes among people with cystic fibrosis has increased with improvement in life expectancy. However, little is known about how patients respond to and manage cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, and how this compares with people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Design. Qualitative research was undertaken in order to fully explore meanings and views. Methods. Semi-structured telephone or face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients who had cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or type 1 diabetes mellitus, during which, they discussed diagnosis and management of diabetes. Framework analysis was employed to identify themes and to consider similarities and differences between the two groups. Results. Eleven cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and 12 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients were interviewed in 2006. Patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes described their diabetes diagnosis as a progression of their primary illness, management of which was important owing to the benefits it brought to their cystic fibrosis. Those with type 1 diabetes mellitus were more likely to report feeling psychologically low because of diabetes and to list long-term complications as a key factor motivating self-management. Both groups struggled to balance the demands of diabetes with other life and health obligations, and experienced isolation because of diabetes. Conclusions. Variation in perceptions recalled during interviews stemmed from diabetes being part of an existing life-threatening chronic illness in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Similarities and differences in attitudes and management practices were found, with less urgency regarding glucose monitoring and fewer information resources available for those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Relevance to clinical practice. Both groups need support for optimal diabetes management and access to appropriate resources outside specialist clinics. Web-based technologies could prove useful for those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes as face-to-face interaction may be prevented owing to the risk of cross-infection. © 2008 The Authors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.591)  Language reflects and shapes our thoughts, feelings, behaviours and experiences and can have a profound impact on the lives of people with and at risk for diabetes. Inappropriate language has a negative impact on self-efficacy, well-being and confidence of people living with diabetes, can seriously undermine experiences with health-care providers and, more broadly, can contribute to diabetes stigma. To date, Diabetes Canada has had no formal position to facilitate positive and affirming attitudes towards diabetes, which is reflected by the use of more appropriate language around diabetes. This consensus statement was developed by Diabetes Canada, by a working group comprised of health-care professionals and lived experience subject matter experts (LESME: patient partners) and validated by volunteers from Diabetes Canada's Professional Section and Diabetes Action Canada's Patient Circles. The principles outlined in this document will be valuable in three broad domains: 1) Diabetes Canada's internal and external communications, 2) increasing public awareness of diabetes and reduction of stigma around diabetes and 3) enhancing the health, wellness and self-efficacy of persons living with diabetes. A major strategy to effect change in this third domain will be to disseminate these concepts broadly among all current (and future) health-care professionals to help integrate positive and supportive attitudes in everyday clinical practice.\t\t\n",
      "(0.588)  OBJECTIVE - To estimate the extent to which increasing BMI may explain the rise in type 2 diabetes incidence in British men from 1984 to 2007. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A representative cohort ratio of 6,460 British men was followed-up for type 2 diabetes incidence between 1984 (aged 45-65 years) and 2007 (aged 67-89 years). BMI was ascertained at regular intervals before and during the follow-up. RESULTS - Between 1984-1992 and 1999-2007, the age-adjusted hazard of type 2 diabetes more than doubled (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI 1.75-3.10]). Mean BMI rose by 1.42 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.10-1.74) between 1984 and 1999; this could explain 26% (95% CI 17-38) of the type 2 diabetes increase. CONCLUSIONS - An appreciable portion of the rise in type 2 diabetes can be attributed to BMI changes. A substantial portion remains unexplained, possibly associated with other determinants such as physical activity. This merits further research. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association. \n",

      "(0.635)  The relationship between socioeconomic factors and hospital use is not well understood in the Canadian context. We used the 1991 Canada census and 1990-92 Ontario hospital discharge abstracts for residents of southeast Toronto to calculate crude and age-sex adjusted rates of hospital admission, bed days, and costs by quintile of low-income households. Population-based rates of admission to hospital, bed days and costs were all significantly related to census tract income (p<0.01 for males and females). The number of admissions per person admitted was significantly associated with census tract income (p<0.01 for males and females), but length of stay and resource intensity weight were not. Hospital costs were 50.0% higher for the poorest quintile of neighbourhoods than for the wealthiest and 35.8% higher than for the middle-income quintile. Poor urban neighbourhoods may require more resources than previously anticipated, related to higher hospital admission and readmission rates.\t\t\n",
      "(0.59)  Hospital in the home' or 'hospital at home' services have become popular solutions to the apparent problems of conventional hospital care in many countries. Until recently their evaluation has been limited, and little has been known about their costs and benefits. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of such services has failed to detect a difference in mortality and readmission rates of patients using hospital in the home, but does suggest that these services are acceptable to patients, although not necessarily to their carers. Important questions about professional roles and workloads in hospital at home services need further investigation. Overall it does not appear that such services produce cost savings, although this may depend greatly on local circumstances. This discussion paper uses the findings of a systematic review of the literature evaluating hospital at home and hospital in the home services to answer questions surrounding the supplementary or substitution status of these services.\t\t\n",
      "(0.563)  Background: Institutional deaths (hospitals and nursing homes) are an important issue because they are often at odds with patient preference and associated with high healthcare costs. The aim of this study was to examine deaths in institutions and the role of individual, regional, and healthcare supply characteristics in explaining variation across Swiss Hospital Service Areas (HSAs). Methods: Retrospective study of individuals =66 years old who died in a Swiss institution (hospital or nursing homes) in 2010. Using a two-level logistic regression analysis we examined the amount of variation across HSAs adjusting for individual, regional and healthcare supply measures. The outcome was place of death, defined as death in hospital or nursing homes. Results: In 2010, 41,275 individuals =66 years old died in a Swiss institution; 54 % in nursing homes and 46 % in hospitals. The probability of dying in hospital decreased with increasing age. The OR was 0.07 (95 % CI: 0.05-0.07) for age 91+ years compared to those 66-70 years. Living in peri-urban areas (OR = 1.06 95 % CI: 1.00-1.11) and French speaking region (OR = 1.43 95 % CI: 1.22-1.65) was associated with higher probability of hospital death. Females had lower probability of death in hospital (OR = 0.54 95 % CI: 0.51-0.56). The density of ambulatory care physicians (OR = 0.81 95 % CI: 0.67-0.97) and nursing homes beds (OR = 0.67 95 % CI: 0.56-0.79) was negatively associated with hospital death. The proportion of dying in hospital varied from 38 % in HSAs with lowest proportion of hospital deaths to 60 % in HSAs with highest proportion of hospital deaths (1.6-fold variation). Conclusions: We found evidence for variation across regions in Switzerland in dying in hospital versus nursing homes, indicating possible overuse and underuse of end of life (EOL) services.\t\t\n",
      "(0.557)  Background Hospital patients who use illicit opioids such as heroin may use drugs during an admission or leave the hospital in order to use drugs. There have been reports of patients found dead from drug poisoning on the hospital premises or shortly after leaving the hospital. This study examines whether hospital admission and discharge are associated with increased risk of opioid-related death. Methods and findings We conducted a case-crossover study of opioid-related deaths in England. Our study included 13,609 deaths between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 among individuals aged 18 to 64. For each death, we sampled 5 control days from the period 730 to 28 days before death. We used data from the national Hospital Episode Statistics database to determine the time proximity of deaths and control days to hospital admissions. We estimated the association between hospital admission and opioid-related death using conditional logistic regression, with a reference category of time neither admitted to the hospital nor within 14 days of discharge. A total of 236/13,609 deaths (1.7%) occurred following drug use while admitted to the hospital. The risk during hospital admissions was similar or lower than periods neither admitted to the hospital nor recently discharged, with odds ratios 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; p = 0.75) for the first 14 days of an admission and 0.41 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.56; p < 0.001) for days 15 onwards. 1,088/13,609 deaths (8.0%) occurred in the 14 days after discharge. The risk of opioid-related death increased in this period, with odds ratios of 4.39 (95% CI 3.75 to 5.14; p < 0.001) on days 1 to 2 after discharge and 2.09 (95% CI 1.92 to 2.28; p < 0.001) on days 3 to 14. 11,629/13,609 deaths (85.5%) did not occur close to a hospital admission, and the remaining 656/13,609 deaths (4.8%) occurred in hospital following admission due to drug poisoning. Risk was greater for patients discharged from psychiatric admissions, those who left the hospital against medical advice, and those leaving the hospital after admissions of 7 days or more. The main limitation of the method is that it does not control for time-varying health or drug use within individuals; therefore, hospital admissions coinciding with high-risk periods may in part explain the results. Conclusions Discharge from the hospital is associated with an acute increase in the risk of opioid-related death, and 1 in 14 opioid-related deaths in England happens in the 2 weeks after the hospital discharge. This supports interventions that prevent early discharge and improve linkage with community drug treatment and harm reduction services. \n",

There has been a concerted attempt to move away from this position by those working in children's research with current etiquette highlighting the inclusion of children and the use of a child-friendly methodology (Chappell, 2000). Children with disabilities can represent a challenge to the qualitative researcher due to the combination of maintaining the child's attention and the demands placed on them by their disability.

We studied madarsah enrolment among 53,960 representative households; 853 focus groups of parents discussed enrolment choices. In 2004, 2.6% of all children (3.8% of school-going children) aged 5-9 years attended a madarsah. Children from urban and less educated households were more likely to attend a madarsah, but there was no difference by sex of the child or household vulnerability.

      "(0.62)  Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and causes of blindness (BL), severe visual impairment (SVI), moderate visual impairment (ModVI) and mild visual impairment (MildVI) in children in Narayani Zone, Nepal. Methods: In 2017, 100 population clusters within the Narayani Zone of Nepal were selected using RAAB software. Children (aged 015 years) suspected of having visual problems were identified using Key Informants (KIs) and school teachers and were referred for ophthalmologic examination. Eye care staff actively sought children who failed to present for examination. Causes of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI were categorized using standard World Health Organization definitions. Results: Of 76,588 children selected, 72,900 (95%) were screened. Of 2,158 children referred for examination, 1,322 were referred by teachers and 836 by KIs. A total of 1,617 (75%) children received a detailed examination, of whom 128 children [65 girls (51%)] mean age of 9.4 (± 4.1 years) were confirmed to have BL 7 (5.5%), SVI 16 (12.5%), ModVI 19 (15%) or MildVI 86 (67%). The combined prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI/MildVI was 175/100,000 (95% CI 172178/100,000); BL/SVI/ModVI was 55/100,000 (95% CI 5357/100,000) and the combined BL/SVI estimate was 30/100,000 (95% CI 2931/100,000). The leading causes of BL/SVI/MVI were refractive error 23 (55%) and whole globe disorders 5 (12%). Total avoidable causes were 31 (74%). Conclusion: The prevalence of BL/SVI/ModVI among children in Narayani Zone was moderate and included a high proportion of avoidable and treatable cases. Pediatric ophthalmic services need improvement, mainly refractive error correction in rural areas of Nepal.\t\t\n",
      "(0.616)  This cross-sectional and exploratory study aimed to compare motor performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) attention levels in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and those with typical development, and determine the relationship between motor performance and the real-time EEG attention level in children with DCD. Eighty-six children with DCD [DCD: n=57; DCD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): n=29] and 99 children with typical development were recruited. Their motor performance was assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) and attention during the tasks of the MABC was evaluated by EEG. All children with DCD had higher MABC impairment scores and lower EEG attention scores than their peers (P<0.05). After accounting for age, sex, body mass index, and physical activity level, the attention index remained significantly associated with the MABC total impairment score and explained 14.1% of the variance in children who had DCD but not ADHD (P=0.009) and 17.5% of the variance in children with both DCD and ADHD (P=0.007). Children with DCD had poorer motor performance and were less attentive to movements than their peers. Their poor motor performance may be explained by inattention. \n",

      "(0.679)  This study explores the fundamental nature of the iconic gestures that speakers produce alongside speech in story-telling by analyzing whether these gestures are sensitive to the judged importance of individual elements in a story. The study focused on two individual semantic features, namely \"size\" and \"relative position\" and identified each and every instance of these in 180 narrations and analyzed whether these were encoded in speech, in gesture, or in speech and gesture. 'Importance' was assessed by asking ten judges (per story) to identify the five most important instances of \"size\" and the five most important instances of \"relative position\" and this was used, employing various statistical algorithms, to calibrate the significance of each element of the story. The study found that overall gestures were significantly more likely to encode high importance information than medium or low importance information. This was also found with the semantic feature \"size\" considered on its own but there was a reversal of this trend when \"relative position\" information was considered separately. An explanation is offered for this reversal in terms of the way that gestures encode position information in the first place.\t\t\n",
      "(0.554)  The literature indicates males are more risk-seeking than females. This study examines whether anxiety increases the gender gap in risk-seeking, whereas sadness closes the gender gap in risk-seeking, a pattern we call the Emotional Fluctuation Effect. In two studies, one with an adolescent sample and the other employing an adult sample, we find similar levels of risk-seeking when males are in anxious or sad states. By contrast, anxious females are less riskseeking than anxious males (study 1 and study 2), and anxious adolescent girls are less risk-seeking than sad adolescent girls (study 1). Together our findings indicate that gender differences in risk-seeking can be explained in part by anxious girls and women avoiding risky behaviors.\t\t\n",

There are aspects of their methodology and discussion that would benefit from examination. Roggli and Green have relied upon a paper by Harper et al. for their definitions of asbestiform and cleavage fragments. Unfortunately, they have misinterpreted the work of those authors who have concluded that the best criterion is a particle width <1µm. Roggli and Green conclude that Our findings demonstrate the lack of pathogenicity of fibers less than 10 µm long or likelihood of cleavage fragments for fibers less than 10µm long and greater than 1.0µm in diameter has little or no effect on the classification of commercial amphibole fibers using our analytical methodology. On the other hand, both lack of pathogenicity and likelihood of cleavage fragments apply to a significant proportion of noncommercial amphiboles identified using our counting scheme. This is not true. The study of Roggli and Green was a simple fiber counting study with no control population. The design of such a study does not allow the investigator to draw any conclusions about pathogenicity, or lack thereof.\t\t\n",

Information was collected by postal questionnaire and observational walk-through surveys. Industrial hygiene walk-through surveys were conducted at 22 work sites, and measurements for wood dust, noise, and bioaerosol were taken. The aim of the study was to obtain data on the current status regarding health and safety characteristics and an estimate of wood dust, noise, and bioaerosol exposures. The occupational exposure to wood dust and noise are similar to what has been reported in this industry in Canada and elsewhere. Airborne wood dust concentration ranged between 0.001mg/m<sup>3</sup> and 4.87mg/m<sup>3</sup> as total dust and noise exposure ranged between 55 and 117dB(A). The study indicates the need for a more comprehensive industry-wide study of wood dust, noise, and bioaersols. © 2010 Dave K. Verma et al.\t\t\n",

      "(0.841)  In Purity and Danger, Douglas theorizes purity and impurity in terms of the instantiation and disruption of a shared symbolic order. Purity/impurity discourses act, according to Purity and Danger, as a homeostatic system which ensures the preservation of this social whole, generally encoding that which threatens social equilibrium as impurity. There have been calls for new social theory on this under-theorized topic. Presenting such further reflections, I argue that Douglas account is less a full explanation than a regularity. Representations of purity are only secondarily symbols of the social order. Rather, purity/impurity discourses are only associated with matter out of place when phenomena are assessed for their relative deviation from an imputed state of self-identity: qualitative homogeneity and correspondence with their essence. Purity and impurity do more than judge self-identity, however. They can play a fundamental role in its performative construction; they are well adapted for smuggling assumptions into our discourses regarding the essence of particular phenomena and forms of subjectivity, simplifying a complex world into a stark contrast between the dangerous and the innocent, the valuable and the valueless, the necessary and the contingent, the originary and the prosthetic, the real and the apparent, and the unitary and the fragmented. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

      "(0.718)  The Web represents a collection of socio-technical activities interoperating using a set of common protocols and standards. Online banking, web TV, internet shopping, e-government and social networking are all different kinds of human interaction that have recently leveraged the capabilities of the Web architecture. Activities that have human and computer components are referred to as social machines. This paper introduces HTP, a sociotechnical model to understand, describe and analyze the formation and development of social machines and other web activities. HTP comprises three components: heterogeneous networks of actors involved in a social machine; the iterative process of translation of the actors' activities into a temporarily stable and sustainable social machine; and the different phases of this machine's adaptation from one stable state to another as the surrounding networks restructure and global agendas ebb and flow. The HTP components are drawn from an interdisciplinary range of theoretical positions and concepts. HTP provides an analytical framework to explain why different Web activities remain stable and functional, whilst others fail. We illustrate the use of HTP by examining the formation of a classic social machine (Wikipedia), and the stabilization points corresponding to its different phases of development.\t\t\n",
      "(0.694)  In contrast to functionalist explanations of themes of purity and impurity as an expression and affirmation of the social order (e.g. Emile Durkheim, Mary Douglas), Giorgio Agamben considers purity and impurity as comparisons of phenomena with their imputed essence. From the perspective offered by Agamben, judgements regarding purity and impurity can be seen as in part constructing the essence against which they supposedly simply measure phenomena. Agamben's investigations suggest that on occasions when themes of purity or impurity are invoked within Western discourses on subjectivity, the full human subject tends to be placed as relatively pure: neither too close nor too distant from human essence. Following Walter Benjamin, he suggests that such a classification gives the full human subject a certain social protection and inviolability, separating relatively pure and protected human life from impure subjectivities unprotected by social or legal conventions.\t\t\n",
      "(0.606)  In this paper we outline some of the challenges for social media analytics and - at the same time - challenge existing approaches to social media analysis. Specifically, we suggest that there is an unhelpful gulf between social scientific approaches, which offer rich theoretical and methodological understandings of the social; and computational approaches which offer sophisticated methods for data harvesting, interrogation and modelling. Brought together these approaches might meet the challenges facing social media analytics and produce a different order of understanding. We offer two preliminary examples of this synthesis in practice: first, we show how established computational tools might be harnessed to address theoretically grounded empirical questions about the social; and second we consider social theories might inspire the development of new methodological tools for social media analytics. In doing so, we aim to contribute to the development of interdisciplinary social media analytics with in a broader framework of Web Science. Copyright © 2014 ACM. \n",

      "(0.79)  Identifying the relevant geography is an ongoing obstacle to effectively evaluating the influence of neighborhood built environment on physical activity. We characterized density and diversity of destinations that 77 older adults experienced within individually representative Global Positioning System (GPS) activity spaces and traditional residential buffers and assessed their associations with accelerometry-measured physical activity. Traditional residential buffers had lower destination density and diversity than activity spaces. Activity spaces based only on pedestrian and bicycling trips had higher destination densities than all-mode activity spaces. Regardless of neighborhood definition, adjusted associations between destinations and physical activity generally failed to reach statistical significance. However, within pedestrian and bicycling-based activity spaces, each additional destination type was associated with 243.3 more steps/day (95% confidence interval (CI) [36.0, 450.7]). Traditional buffers may not accurately portray the geographic space or neighborhood resources experienced by older adults. Pedestrian and bicycling activity spaces elucidate the importance of destinations for facilitating active transportation.\t\t\n",

From this foundation, it critically reviews the influence of physical activity on bone mass accrual in boys. It then discusses the emerging data describing material and structural properties that underpin the bone strength response to physical activity. The chapter closes with a discussion of whether benefits of physical activity undertaken during the growing years are sustained across the lifespan. Effective weight-bearing physical activity can be attained through a wide range of extra-curricular sports and activities and through targeted school-based programs. It is more difficult to pinpoint the \"window of opportunity\" when the growing skeleton is most responsive to exercise-induced loads. Although pre- and early puberty may well be the most opportune times to maximize the positive impact of physical activity on the growing skeleton, the timing may vary by site. For example, boys' bone strength is enhanced through exercise at the clinically relevant femoral neck (through periosteal apposition) during early puberty, whereas structural adaptations at the tibia are evident in prepuberty. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

      "(0.674)  Background: The physical environment can facilitate or hinder physical activity. A challenge in promoting physical activity is ensuring that the physical environment is supportive and that these supports are appropriately tailored to the individual or group in question. Ideally, aspects of the environment that impact physical activity would be enhanced, but environmental changes take time, and identifying ways to provide more precision to physical activity recommendations might be helpful for specific individuals or groups. Therefore, moving beyond a one size fits all to a precision-based approach is critical. Main body: To this end, we considered 4 critical aspects of the physical environment that influence physical activity (walkability, green space, traffic-related air pollution, and heat) and how these aspects could enhance our ability to precisely guide physical activity. Strategies to increase physical activity could include optimizing design of the built environment or mitigating of some of the environmental impediments to activity through personalized or population-wide interventions. Conclusions: Although at present non-personalized approaches may be more widespread than those tailored to one persons physical environment, targeting intrinsic personal elements (e.g., medical conditions, sex, age, socioeconomic status) has interesting potential to enhance the likelihood and ability of individuals to participate in physical activity.\t\t\n",
      "(0.611)  Affective barriers like negative affect (time-varying subjective state) or fear of falling (person-trait) may reduce daily physical activity among older adults. A group of 123 community-dwelling older adults (Ma = ENGL = 71.83, range = 64 85, 63% women) from Canada participated in a 10-day time-sampling study. We used accelerometer-assessed physical activity, assessing negative affect three times per day and fear of falling once prior to the 10-day period. Using multilevel models, we noted considerable variability in physical activity between days (activity counts: 47%; steps: 55%). We found time-varying negative associations between daily physical activity and daily negative affect. Fear of falling was not related to daily physical activity. Findings point to the merit of examining time-varying differences in subjective experiences when looking for physical activity barriers in older age.\t\t\n",
      "(0.596)  Objectives: Physical activity is a key health behavior that reduces disease risk, and yet most older adults are not very active. This study examined time-varying associations between physical activity and a recognized barrier, namely, precipitation. And it examined the moderating role of physical activity intentions and functional mobility on precipitationphysical activity associations. Method: One hundred and twenty-six older adults (M age = 72 years; 64% women) from Metro Vancouver provided health and background information and wore triaxial accelerometers for up to 10 consecutive days. Daily weather information was collected from local weather stations. Results: Multilevel models corroborate previous research by showing that older adults engaged in less physical activity on days with increased precipitation across four indices: activity counts, step counts, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and bout-corrected minutes of MVPA. Older adults with strong physical activity intentions engaged in more physical activity overall. Physical activity intentions also modified the association between time-varying precipitation and activity counts and step counts, whereas functional mobility moderated the negative association between precipitation and activity counts and minutes of MVPA. Discussion: Findings highlight the important role of time-varying influences on physical activity and how these associations are moderated by psychological and biological factors. \n",

There is a surprising dearth of journal clubs which deal with articles related to the science of medical education. Aims: In an effort to expose medical educators to the outstanding benefits of medical education journal clubs we have devised a set of twelve tips to success for such clubs. Methods: We conducted a survey of journal club directors at the nine Canadian medical schools known to conduct education journal clubs. We also conducted interviews with all members of the McGill University Centre for Medical Education.

      "(0.732)  Teaching medical students to respond to needs of the dying represents an important challenge for medical educators. This article describes the goals and objectives that should be identified before medical schools can meet this challenge, as well as strategies that, when implemented, will provide students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to meet the needs of the dying patients. The goals and objectives were identified through a modified group consensus process developed during Choice In Dying's 5-year project 'Integrating Education on Care of the Dying into Medical Schools.' The authors have diverse experiences and backgrounds and are actively involved in death and dying teaching at 11 medical schools. They conclude that after accepting the goals and objectives, key medical school faculty can work cooperatively to develop strategies to integrate them into the school's curriculum. Without first establishing a set of goals and objectives and developing evaluation methods, medical schools could miss their mark in fostering the student's ability to care for the dying.\t\t\n",
      "(0.721)  Context: There have been repeated calls for the greater use of conceptual frameworks and of theory in medical education. Although it is familiar to few medical educators, Michel Foucault's work is a helpful theoretical and methodological source. Methods: This article explores what it means to use a 'Foucauldian approach', presents a sample of Foucault's historical-genealogical studies that are relevant to medical education, and introduces the work of four researchers currently undertaking Foucauldian-inspired medical education research. Results: Although they are not without controversy, Foucauldian approaches are employed by an increasing number of scholars and are helpful in shedding light on what it is possible to think, say and be in medical education. Conclusions: Our hope in sharing this Foucauldian work and perspective is that we might stimulate a dialogue that is forward-looking and optimistic about the possibilities for change in medical education. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\t\t\n",
      "(0.706)  Students with sensory and physical disabilities are underrepresented in medical schools despite the availability of assistive technologies and accommodations. Unfortunately, many medical schools have adopted restrictive \"organic\" technical standards based on deficits rather than on the ability to do the work. Compelling ethical considerations of justice and beneficence should prompt change in this arena. Medical schools should instead embrace \"functional\" technical standards that permit accommodations for disabilities and update their admissions policies to promote applications from qualified students with disabilities. Medical schools thus should focus on what students with disabilities can do, rather than what they cannot do, because these students further diversify the health care profession and improve our ability to care for an expanding population of patients with disabilities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.705)  Increasing attention has been focused on developing professionalism in medical school graduates. Unfortunately, the culture of academic medical centers and the behaviors that faculty model are often incongruent with our image of professionalism. The need for improved role modeling, better assessment of student behavior, and focused faculty development is reviewed. We propose that the incentive structure be adjusted to reward professional behavior in both students and faculty. The third-year medicine clerkship provides an ideal opportunity for clinician-educators to play a leading role in evaluating, rewarding, and ultimately fostering professionalism in medical school graduates. \n",

Some of the literature identifies Choosing Wisely as a shared decision-making approach. We evaluated the patient materials developed by Choosing Wisely Canada to determine whether they meet the criteria for shared decision-making tools known as patient decision aids. Design: Descriptive analysis of all Choosing Wisely Canada patient materials. Data source: In May 2015, we selected all Choosing Wisely Canada patient materials from its official website. Main outcomes and measures: Four team members independently extracted characteristics of the English materials using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) modified 16-item minimum criteria for qualifying and certifying patient decision aids. The research team discussed discrepancies between data extractors and reached a consensus. Descriptive analysis was conducted. Results: Of the 24 patient materials assessed, 12 were about treatments, 11 were about screening and 1 was about prevention. The median score for patient materials using IPDAS criteria was 10/16 (range: 8-11) for screening topics and 6/12 (range: 6-9) for prevention and treatment topics. Commonly missed criteria were stating the decision (21/24 did not), providing balanced information on option benefits/harms (24/24 did not), citing evidence (24/24 did not) and updating policy (24/24 did not). Out of 24 patient materials, only 2 met the 6 IPDAS criteria to qualify as patient decision aids, and neither of these 2 met the 6 certifying criteria. Conclusions: Patient materials developed by Choosing Wisely Canada do not meet the IPDAS minimal qualifying or certifying criteria for patient decision aids. Modifications to the Choosing Wisely Canada patient materials would help to ensure that they qualify as patient decision aids and thus as more effective shared decision-making tools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.641)  Introduction: Patient decision aids could facilitate shared decision-making in joint replacement surgery. However, patient decision aids are not routinely used in this setting. Methods: With a view to developing a patient decision aid for UK hip/ knee joint replacement practice, we undertook a systematic search of the literature for evidence on the use of shared decision-making and patient decision aids in orthopaedics, and a national survey of consultant orthopaedic surgeons on the potential acceptability and feasibility of patient decision aids. Results: We found little published evidence regarding shared decision-making or patient decision aids in orthopaedics. In the survey, 362 of 639 (57%) randomly selected consultant orthopaedic surgeons responded. Respondents appear representative of consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the UK. Of 272 valid responses, 79% (95% Cl, 73-85%) thought patient decision aids a good or excellent idea. There was consensus on the potential helpfulness of patient decision aids and core content. A booklet to take home was the preferred medium/practice model. Conclusions: Despite the increased emphasis on patient involvement in decision-making, there is little evidence in the medical literature relating to shared decision-making or the use of patient decision aids in orthopaedic surgery. Further research in this area of clinical practice is required. Our survey shows that consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the UK are generally positive about the use of patient decision aids for joint replacement surgery. Survey results could inform future development of patient decision aids for joint replacement practice in the UK.\t\t\n",
      "(0.621)  Purpose: Decision-makers are looking for innovative approaches to improve patient experience and outcomes with the finite resources available in healthcare. The concept of value-based healthcare has been proposed as one such approach. Since unsafe care hinders patient experience and contributes to waste, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the value-based approach can help broaden the existing concept of patient safety culture and thus, improve patient safety and healthcare value. Design/methodology/approach: In the arguments, the authors use the triple value model which consists of personal, technical and allocative value. These three aspects together promote healthcare in which the experience of care is improved through the involvement of patients, while also considering the optimal utilisation and allocation of finite healthcare resources. Findings: While the idea that patient involvement should be integrated into patient safety culture has already been suggested, there is a lack of emphasis that economic considerations can play an important role as well. Patient safety should be perceived as an investment, thus, relevant questions need to be addressed such as how much resources should be invested into patient safety, how the finite resources should be allocated to maximise health benefits at a population level and how resources should be utilised to get the best cost-benefit ratio. Originality/value: Thus far, both the importance of patient safety culture and value-based healthcare have been advocated; this paper emphasizes the need to consider these two approaches together.\t\t\n",
      "(0.602)  Question. In the 1960s, Dr Cameron, a Montreal, Que, psychiatrist, experimented with drug-induced sleep and electroconvulsive therapy for psychiatric patients, believing that this method \"wipes them clean of harmful memories.\" In 1992 the government of Canada settled lawsuits by former patients of Dr Cameron, awarding them large payments. The government rejected a similar claim by Lloyd Schrier, whose mother had been treated by Dr Cameron while she was carrying Lloyd, arguing that Lloyd was not Cameron's patient. Or was he? Answer. The fetus was exposed to the medications taken by his mother, (eg, barbiturates) and thus qualifies as an unconsenting patient.\t\t\n",
      "(0.583)  Background Patient groups represent the interest of their members when it comes to drug funding. Many patient groups receive grants from pharmaceutical companies that make products being considered for funding. This research examines whether there is an association between the positions that Canadian groups take about the products and conflicts of interest with the companies. Methods The Common Drug Review (CDR) and panCanadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) make recommendations to Canadian provincial and federal drug plans about funding particular drug-indications. Both utilize input from patient groups in making their recommendations. Patient group submissions are available from both organizations and these submissions contain statements about conflicts of interest. Views of the patient groups, with and without a conflict with the company making the drug under consideration and without any conflicts at all, were assessed and then compared with the recommendations from CDR and pCODR. Results There was a total of 222 reports for drug-indications. There were 372 submissions from 93 different patient groups. Groups declared a total of 1896 conflicts with drug companies in 324 (87.1%) individual submissions. There were 268 submissions where groups declared a conflict with the company making the product or said they had no conflict. Irrespective of whether there was a conflict, the views of patient groups about the drug-indications under consideration were the same. There was no statistically significant difference between views of patient groups and the recommendations from CDR and/or pCODR. Conclusions The large majority of patient groups making submissions about funding of particular drug-indications had conflicts with the companies making the products and their views about the products were almost always positive. This association between funding and views needs to be further investigated to determine if a true cause and effect exists. \n",

      "(0.797)  Movie alcohol exposure is a known and consistent predictor of adolescent alcohol use initiation and escalation. Nearly 90% of the top U.S. movies contain alcohol content. Social- cognitive theory posits reciprocal links among environmental influences (e.g., movie alcohol exposure), social- cognitive processes (e.g., perceived norms, susceptibility, alcohol outcome expectancies), and behavior (alcohol use), but these links have been tested in only 1 direction. In the current study, we assessed movie alcohol exposure, alcohol cognitions, and alcohol initiation among adolescents (N = 1,023; 52% female, mean age = 13.7 years) in 4 annual survey waves. Cross-lagged panel models tested bidirectional relations between cognitions and movie alcohol exposure. Finally, we tested bidirectional mediation effects in the prospective prediction of alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure prospectively predicted increases in descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and susceptibility but not positive or negative alcohol outcome expectancies. All factors predicted subsequent alcohol initiation. Close friend injunctive and descriptive norms, peer descriptive norms, and susceptibility mediated the effect of earlier movie alcohol exposure on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure mediated the effect of earlier close friend descriptive norms on subsequent alcohol initiation. Movie alcohol exposure and social-cognitive processes are interrelated facets that impact alcohol initiation. Permissive cognitions infrequently predicted higher subsequent exposure to movie alcohol. Clinical and preventative implications of this work are discussed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.782)  Animal models of substance abuse have established a role for the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC) in drug taking behaviour for several addictive substances, yet nothing has thus far been reported for alcohol. The current research was undertaken to examine the involvement of the CGIC in a rat model of alcohol self-administration. We investigated the inactivating effects of local infusions of a <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid agonist mixture (baclofen/muscimol) into the CGIC on alcohol self-administration under a fixed ratio-3 (FR-3). This inactivation of the CGIC decreased operant responding for alcohol along with a corresponding decrease in oral alcohol intake. Our results demonstrate the involvement of the CGIC in alcohol taking behaviour and suggest future studies examine the differential involvement of the various subregions of the insular cortex in various aspects of alcohol consumption.\t\t\n",
      "(0.762)  Objectives. To examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol availability before and after deregulation in 2015 of the alcohol market in Ontario, Canada. Methods. We quantified alcohol access by number of alcohol outlets and hours of retail for all 19 964 neighborhoods in Ontario. We used mixed effects regression models to examine the associations between alcohol access and a validated SES index between 2013 and 2017. Results. Following deregulation, the number of alcohol outlets in Ontario increased by 15.0%. Low neighborhood SES was positively associated with increased alcohol access: lower-SES neighborhoods had more alcohol outlets within 1000 meters and were closer to the nearest alcohol outlets. Outlets located in low-SES neighborhoods kept longer hours of operation. Conclusions. We observed a substantial increase in alcohol access in Ontario following deregulation. Access to alcohol was greatest in low-SES neighborhoods and may contribute to established inequities in alcohol harms. Public Health Implications. Placing limits on number of alcohol outlets and the hours of operation in low-SES neighborhoods offers an opportunity to reduce alcohol-related health inequities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.719)  Aims The average US adolescent is exposed to 34 references to alcohol in popular music daily. Although brand recognition is an independent, potent risk factor for alcohol outcomes among adolescents, alcohol brand appearances in popular music have not been assessed systematically. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and contextual elements associated with alcohol brand appearances in US popular music. Design Qualitative content analysis. Setting We used Billboard Magazine to identify songs to which US adolescents were most exposed in 2005-07. For each of the 793 songs, two trained coders analyzed independently the lyrics of each song for references to alcohol and alcohol brand appearances. Subsequent in-depth assessments utilized Atlas.ti to determine contextual factors associated with each of the alcohol brand appearances. Measurements Our final code book contained 27 relevant codes representing six categories: alcohol types, consequences, emotional states, activities, status and objects. Findings Average inter-rater reliability was high (<U+03BA>=0.80), and all differences were easily adjudicated. Of the 793 songs in our sample, 169 (21.3%) referred explicitly to alcohol, and of those, 41 (24.3%) contained an alcohol brand appearance. Consequences associated with alcohol were more often positive than negative (41.5% versus 17.1%, P<0.001). Alcohol brand appearances were associated commonly with wealth (63.4%), sex (58.5%), luxury objects (51.2%), partying (48.8%), other drugs (43.9%) and vehicles (39.0%). Conclusions One in five songs sampled from US popular music had explicit references to alcohol, and one-quarter of these mentioned a specific alcohol brand. These alcohol brand appearances are associated commonly with a luxury life-style characterized by wealth, sex, partying and other drugs. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.\t\t\n",
      "(0.679)  Aims: To assess the immediate effect of alcohol promoting and alcohol warning advertisements on implicit and explicit attitudes towards alcohol and on alcohol seeking behaviour. Methods: We conducted a between-participants online experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to view one of three sets of advertisements: (a) alcohol promoting, (b) alcohol warning, or (c) unrelated to alcohol. A total of 373 participants (59.5% female) aged 18-40 (M= 28.03) living in the UK were recruited online through a research agency. Positive and negative implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes towards alcohol were assessed before and after advertisements were viewed. Alcohol seeking behaviourwas measured by participants' choice of either an alcohol-related or non-alcohol-related voucher offered ostensibly as a reward for participation. Self-reported past week alcohol consumption was also recorded. Results: There were no main effects on any of the outcome measures. In heavier drinkers, viewing alcohol promoting advertisements increased positive implicit attitudes (standardized beta = 0.15, P = 0.04) and decreased negative implicit attitudes (standardized beta = -0.17, P = 0.02). In heavier drinkers, viewing alcohol warning advertisements decreased negative implicit attitudes (standardized beta = -0.19, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Viewing alcohol promoting advertisements has a cognitive impact on heavier drinkers, increasing positive and reducing negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol. Viewing alcohol warning advertisements reduces negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol in heavier drinkers, suggestive of a reactance effect. \n",

      "(0.801)  Purpose: Neural invasion (NI) is a histopathologic feature of colon cancer that receives little consideration. Therefore, we conducted a morphologic and functional characterization of NI in colon cancer. Experimental Design: NI was investigated in 673 patients with colon cancer. Localization and severity of NI was determined and related to patient's prognosis and survival. The neuro-affinity of colon cancer cells (HT29, HCT-116, SW620, and DLD-1) was compared with pancreatic cancer (T3M4 and SU86.86) and rectal cancer cells (CMT-93) in the in vitro three-dimensional (3D)-neural-migration assay and analyzed via live-cell imaging. Immunoreactivity of the neuroplasticity marker GAP-43, and the neurotrophic-chemoattractant factors Artemin and nerve growth factor (NGF), was quantified in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer nerves. Dorsal root ganglia of newborn rats were exposed to supernatants of colon cancer, rectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer cells and neurite density was determined. Results: NI was detected in 210 of 673 patients (31.2%). Although increasing NI severity scores were associated with a significantly poorer survival, presence of NI was not an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer. In the 3D migration assay, colon cancer and rectal cancer cells showed much less neurite-targeted migration when compared with pancreatic cancer cells. Supernatants of pancreatic cancer and rectal cancer cells induced a much higher neurite density than those of colon cancer cells. Accordingly, NGF, Artemin, and GAP-43 were much more pronounced in nerves in pancreatic cancer than in colon cancer. Conclusion: NI is not an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer. The lack of a considerable biologic affinity between colon cancer cells and neurons, the low expression profile of colonic nerves for chemoattractant molecules, and the absence of a major neuroplasticity in colon cancer may explain the low prevalence and impact of NI in colon cancer. ©2012 AACR.\t\t\n",
      "(0.603)  Glycolysis has been one of the major hallmarks of cancer, as cancer cells exhibit a high rate of glucose consumption beyond that required for energy production. Glucose acts as a substrate to generate biomass and regulates cell signaling that is required for the cancer progression. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) have been majorly playing their role in glucose transport across the cell membrane to meet their metabolic demands. Overexpression of GLUTs has been reported in various cancer types. Also, activation of certain oncogenes such as c-myc, ras, and src and several other transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1a induces the overexpression of GLUTs in cancer cells. GLUT regulation has been studied on the epigenetic level as well to provide fundamental information on its regulation. Targeting and understanding GLUTs function in cancer cells could pave novel path for therapeutic strategies against cancer.\t\t\n",
      "(0.593)  Germline mutations in the DNA base excision repair gene MUTYH are known to increase a carrier's risk of colorectal cancer. However, the risks of other (extracolonic) cancers for MUTYH mutation carriers are not well defined. We identified 266 probands (91% Caucasians) with a MUTYH mutation (41 biallelic and 225 monoallelic) from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Mutation status, sex, age and histories of cancer from their 1,903 first- and 3,255 second-degree relatives were analyzed using modified segregation analysis conditioned on the ascertainment criteria. Compared with incidences for the general population, hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: urinary bladder cancer 19 (3.797) and ovarian cancer 17 (2.4115). The HRs (95% CI) for monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers were: gastric cancer 9.3 (6.713); hepatobiliary cancer 4.5 (2.77.5); endometrial cancer 2.1 (1.13.9) and breast cancer 1.4 (1.02.0). There was no evidence for an increased risk of cancers at the other sites examined (brain, pancreas, kidney or prostate). Based on the USA population incidences, the estimated cumulative risks (95% CI) to age 70 years for biallelic mutation carriers were: bladder cancer 25% (577%) for males and 8% (233%) for females and ovarian cancer 14% (265%). The cumulative risks (95% CI) for monoallelic mutation carriers were: gastric cancer 5% (47%) for males and 2.3% (1.73.3%) for females; hepatobiliary cancer 3% (25%) for males and 1.4% (0.82.3%) for females; endometrial cancer 3% (2%6%) and breast cancer 11% (816%). These unbiased estimates of both relative and absolute risks of extracolonic cancers for people, mostly Caucasians, with MUTYH mutations will be important for their clinical management.\t\t\n",
      "(0.591)  Background Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Previous studies have shown that MMR gene mutation carriers are at increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and several other cancers following an initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We estimated cancer risks following an endometrial cancer diagnosis for women carrying MMR gene mutations. Methods We obtained data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry for a cohort of 127 women who had a diagnosis of endometrial cancer and who carried a mutation in one of four MMR genes (30 carried a mutation in MLH1, 72 in MSH2, 22 in MSH6, and 3 in PMS2). We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate 10- and 20-year cumulative risks for each cancer. We estimated the age-, country-, and calendar period-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each cancer, compared with the general population. Results Following endometrial cancer, women carrying MMR gene mutations had the following 20-year risks of other cancer cancers: colorectal cancer (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 62%); cancer of the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter (11%, 95% CI = 3% to 20%); urinary bladder cancer (9%, 95% CI = 2% to 17%); and breast cancer (11%, 95% CI = 4% to 19%). Compared with the general population, these women were at statistically significantly elevated risks of colorectal cancer (SIR = 39.9, 95% CI = 27.2 to 58.3), cancer of the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter (SIR = 28.3, 95% CI = 11.9 to 48.6), urinary bladder cancer (SIR = 24.3, 95% CI = 8.56 to 42.9), and breast cancer (SIR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.17 to 4.14). Conclusions Women with Lynch syndrome who are diagnosed with endometrial cancer have increased risks of several cancers, including breast cancer. © The Author 2012.

      "(0.566)  Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin malignancy in men. Almost all men who die from prostate cancer have hormone-refractory prostate cancer with metastasis to bone. Emerging supportive treatments - including chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, and surgery - require integration that is optimized in a multidisciplinary setting. A multidisciplinary clinic for bone metastases has been in place at Toronto - Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre since 1999, combining orthopedic surgery, radiation oncology, interventional radiology, and palliative medicine for all patients with bone metastases. The addition of a prostate-focused multidisciplinary clinic integrates these services for patients with advanced prostate cancer. \n",

      "(0.712)  Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pre-treatment subject characteristics and weight change during the first weeks of a low-calorie diet (LCD) can predict weight loss outcomes at the end of a controlled 8-week weight loss period in overweight and obese adults. Subjects: A total of 932 overweight and obese subjects of both genders were included at eight European centers, and underwent an 8-week LCD period. Results: The weight loss at week 8 was positively correlated with initial body weight (Spearman's =<U+03C1>0.62), height (=<U+03C1>0.43), body mass index (=<U+03C1>0.43), waist (=<U+03C1>0.48) and hip circumference (=<U+03C1>0.33), sagittal diameter (=<U+03C1>0.45), fat mass (=<U+03C1>0.35) and fat-free mass (=<U+03C1>0.52), and gender (=<U+03C1>-0.36) (all <P0.01). In the multivariate regression model, adjusted for center, only initial body weight, early weight loss (week 1) and weight loss at week 3 were significant predictors of weight loss outcome at week 8: weight loss (kg) at week 80.090.046 × baseline body weight (kg)-0.311 × weight loss (kg) at week 1+1.284 × weight loss (kg) at week 3 (R2 68%, P<0.0001). A weight loss of 2.6 kg at week 1 during the LCD period was identified as the optimal cut-off predictor for at least 10 kg weight loss at week 8. Conclusions: This study suggests that initial body weight, early weight loss (week 1) and weight loss at week 3 are predictors of final weight loss during an 8-week LCD, and may be used as early biomarkers of subsequent responses to an LCD diet. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.\t\t\n",
      "(0.585)  Objective Weight loss helps reduce the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the obese, but weight regain after active weight loss is common. The changes and predictive role of circulating adipokines and sex hormones for weight regain in men during dietary intervention, and also the effect of basal MetS status on weight regain, were investigated. Design and Methods Twenty-four men who continued to lose weight (WL) and 24 men who regained weight (WR) during the 6-month follow-up period after weight loss were selected from the Diogenes Study. Their circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), luteinizing hormone, prolactin, progesterone, total and free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at baseline, after 8-week low-calorie diet-induced active weight loss, and after a subsequent 26-week ad libitum weight maintenance diet, and analyzed together with anthropometrical and physiological parameters. Results Overweight and obese men with MetS at baseline had higher risk to regain weight (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.015). High baseline RBP4, low total testosterone, and low SHBG are predictors of weight loss regain (different between WR and WL with P = 0.001, 0.038, and 0.044, respectively). Conclusions These variables may play roles in the link between MetS and weight loss regain. Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.\t\t\n",
      "(0.583)  Background Involuntary weight loss is associated with higher mortality. When this weight loss is unrecognised, opportunities for timely diagnosis of significant conditions may be missed. Objective To use electronic health record (EHR) data to estimate the frequency of unrecognised involuntary weight loss and its implications. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the weights recorded in an EHR of 100,000 adult patients seen in outpatient clinics over a 5-year period using a novel data visualisation and review tool. We reviewed charts of a random sample of 170 patients experiencing weight loss periods. Our outcomes included 1) determination of whether weight loss was voluntary versus involuntary; 2) determination of whether weight loss was recognised and documented and 3) possible explanations identifiable at the index visit or within the subsequent 2 years. Results Of 170 randomly selected weight loss periods reviewed, 22 (13%) were involuntary, 36 (21%) were voluntary and 112 (66%) were indeterminate. Sixty- six (39%) weight loss periods were recognised by clinicians at the index visits and an additional 3 (1%) at the next PCP visits. Possible explanations for weight loss emerged in the subsequent 2 years including medical conditions in 60 (45%), psychosocial conditions in 19 (14%), erroneous data entry in 9 (7%), voluntary weight loss in 8 (6%) and postpartum weight loss in 6 (4%). No possible explanations were found in 32 (24%). Conclusions Periods of weight loss were common, often involuntary and frequently not recognised or documented. Many patients with involuntary weight loss had potential explanations that emerged within the subsequent 2 years.\t\t\n",
      "(0.568)  Background: Successful weight maintenance following weight loss is challenging for many people. Identifying predictors of longer-term success will help target clinical resources more effectively. To date, focus has been predominantly on the identification of predictors of weight loss. The goal of the current study was to determine if changes in anthropometric and clinical parameters during acute weight loss are associated with subsequent weight regain. Methodology: The study consisted of an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) followed by a 6-month weight maintenance phase. Anthropometric and clinical parameters were analyzed before and after the LCD in the 285 participants (112 men, 173 women) who regained weight during the weight maintenance phase. Mixed model ANOVA, Spearman correlation, and linear regression were used to study the relationships between clinical measurements and weight regain. Principal Findings: Gender differences were observed for body weight and several clinical parameters at both baseline and during the LCD-induced weight loss phase. LCD-induced changes in BMI (Spearman's <U+03C1> = 0.22, p = 0.0002) were inversely associated with weight regain in both men and women. LCD-induced changes in fasting insulin (<U+03C1> = 0.18, p = 0.0043) and HOMA-IR (<U+03C1> = 0.19, p = 0.0023) were also associated independently with weight regain in both genders. The aforementioned associations remained statistically significant in regression models taking account of variables known to independently influence body weight. Conclusions/Significance: LCD-induced changes in BMI, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR are inversely associated with weight regain in the 6-month period following weight loss. © 2012 Wong et al.\t\t\n",
      "(0.566)  Background: The scale of overweight and obesity in the UK places a considerable burden on the NHS. In some areas the NHS has formed partnerships with commercial companies to offer weight management services, but there has been little evaluation of these schemes. This study is an independent audit of the Weight Watchers NHS Referral scheme and evaluates the weight change of obese and overweight adults referred to Weight Watchers (WW) by the NHS. Method. Data was obtained from the WW NHS Referral Scheme database for 29,326 referral courses started after 2nd April 2007 and ending before 6th October 2009 [90% female; median age 49 years (IQR 38 - 61 years); median BMI 35.1 kg/m2 (IQR 31.8 - 39.5 kg/m2). Participants received vouchers (funded by the PCT following referral by a healthcare professional) to attend 12 WW meetings. Body weight was measured at WW meetings and relayed to the central database. Results: Median weight change for all referrals was -2.8 kg [IQR -5.9 - -0.7 kg] representing -3.1% initial weight. 33% of all courses resulted in loss of 5% initial weight. 54% of courses were completed. Median weight change for those completing a first course was -5.4 kg [IQR -7.8 - -3.1 kg] or -5.6% of initial weight. 57% lost 5% initial weight. Conclusions: A third of all patients who were referred to WW through the WW NHS Referral Scheme and started a 12 session course achieved 5% weight loss, which is usually associated with clinical benefits. This is the largest audit of NHS referral to a commercial weight loss programme in the UK and results are comparable with other options for weight loss available through primary care. © 2011 Ahern et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \n",

Objective: To measure geographic variation in quality measures, correlation among measures, and correlation between measures and spending for commercially insured enrollees. Data Source: Administrative claims from the 20072009 Truven MarketScan database. Methods: We calculated variation in, and correlations among, 10 quality measures across 306 Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs), adjusting for beneficiary traits and sample size differences. Further, we created a quality index and correlated it with spending. Results: The coefficient of variation of HRR-level performance ranged from 0.04 to 0.38. Correlations among quality measures generally ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. Quality was modestly positively related to spending.

      "(0.552)  Background: Ethics and quality care are common drivers for healthcare organisations. Both are based on ethics principles that are the foundation for quality, and are synergistic with the Institute of Medicine's six quality aims. This paper describes the relationship between ethics principles and the goals of improving quality, safety and value. It demonstrates how healthcare staff, quality improvement professionals and ethics committee members could apply a quality improvement framework to address and prevent ethics issues. Discussion Recurring ethics issues can have a detrimental impact on both the quality of patient care and the culture of a healthcare organisation. Clinical staff and ethics committee members traditionally respond to ethics issues using a reactive approach. Despite nascent interest in a system-oriented preventive approach to ethics issues, there is limited practical advice for ethics committee members regarding how to specifically implement a system redesign strategy. Using an illustrative case study, the authors demonstrate how to apply a recognised quality improvement framework, which focuses on clinical microsystems, to manage and decrease ethics issuesdtherefore enhancing the organisation's quality of care. Conclusion: An important step in enhancing quality and ethics aims would be for the organisation's staff, including quality improvement professionals and ethics committee members, to collaborate in fostering system redesign. The authors' aim is not to examine in detail a specific quality improvement approach or method; rather, they wish to highlight the synergy they believe exists between quality improvement efforts and organisational ethics issues.\t\t\n",
      "(0.548)  The issue of quality in qualitative research is part of a much larger and contested debate about the nature of the knowledge produced by qualitative research, whether its quality can legitimately be judged according to a single set of general principles and, if so, how. In the field of qualitative research, concern to be able to assess quality has manifested itself in the proliferation of guidelines for doing and judging qualitative work, particularly in the health field. This chapter outlines two views of how qualitative methods might be judged. It then argues that qualitative research can be assessed with reference to the same broad criteria of quality as quantitative research, albeit the meaning attributed to these criteria may not be exactly the same and they may be assessed differently. The chapter concludes with a list of questions that can be used as a guide to assessing the quality of a piece of qualitative research.\t\t\n",
      "(0.5)  This paper reviews and critiques the different approaches to the use of narrative in quality improvement research. The defining characteristics of narrative are chronology (unfolding over time); emplotment (the literary juxtaposing of actions and events in an implicitly causal sequence); trouble (that is, harm or the risk of harm); and embeddedness (the personal story nests within a particular social, historical and organisational context). Stories are about purposeful action unfolding in the face of trouble and, as such, have much to offer quality improvement researchers. But the quality improvement report (a story about efforts to implement change), which is common, must be distinguished carefully from narrative based quality improvement research (focused systematic enquiry that uses narrative methods to generate new knowledge), which is currently none. We distinguish four approaches to the use of narrative in quality improvement research - narrative interview; naturalistic story gathering; organisational case study; and collective sense-making-and offer a rationale, describe how data can be collected and analysed, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each using examples from the quality improvement literature. Narrative research raises epistemological questions about the nature of narrative truth (characterised by sense-making and emotional impact rather than scientific objectivity), which has implications for how rigour should be defined (and how it might be achieved) in this type of research. We offer some provisional guidance for distinguishing high quality narrative research in a quality improvement setting from other forms of narrative account such as report, anecdote, and journalism.\t\t\n",

      "(0.607)  The objective of this study was to determine whether patients with Crohn's disease (CD) value the absolute reduction in postoperative recurrence risk attributable to therapy with mesalamine (5-ASA). One hundred subjects evaluated state A (taking 5-ASA; 25% risk of recurrence), state B (not taking 5-ASA; 40% risk of recurrence), and state C (100% risk of recurrence) by rank order, visual analog scale (VAS), and standard gamble (SG). Sixty-five of 91 patients (71%) with completed and usable questionnaires had the same preference order for state A (25% risk), state B (40% risk), and state C (100% risk) on both the VAS and the SG. The mean scores for state A (25% risk), state B (40% risk), and state C (100% risk), respectively, were 67.5, 49.8, and 19.8 on the VAS and 0.977, 0.972, and 0.910 on the SG. Subgroup analyses using stepwise logistic regression showed that risk attitude seemed to be predictive of subjects' preferences for 5-ASA. These results suggest that most subjects seem to value the 15% absolute risk reduction offered by 5-ASA. Furthermore, the SG seems to be a feasible method for measuring utilities for uncertain health states in patients with CD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.56)  Objective: To synthesize the literature on the effect of provision of personalised cancer risk information to individuals at population level risk on accuracy of risk perception and psychological responses. Methods: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of articles published from 01/01/2000 to 01/07/2017. Results: We included 23 studies. Immediately after provision of risk information 87% of individuals were able to recall the absolute risk estimate. Less than half believed that to be their risk, with up to 71% believing their risk to be higher than the estimate. Provision of risk information increased accuracy of perceived absolute risk immediately after risk information compared with no information (pooled RR 4.16 (95%CI 1.2813.49), 3 studies). There was no significant effect on comparative risk accuracy (pooled RR 1.39 (0.722.69), 2 studies) and either no change or a reduction in cancer worry, anxiety and fear. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complex cognitive processes involved in the conceptualisation of risk. Practice implications: Individuals who appear to understand and are able to recall risk information most likely do not believe it reflects their own risk.\t\t\n",
      "(0.556)  Individuals frequently have difficulty understanding how behavior can reduce genetically-conferred risk for diseases such as colon cancer. With increasing opportunities to purchase genetic tests, communication strategies are needed for presenting information in ways that optimize comprehension and adaptive behavior. Using the Common-Sense Model, we tested the efficacy of a strategy for providing information about the relationships (links) among the physiological processes underlying disease risk and protective action on understanding, protective action motivations, and willingness to purchase tests. We tested the generalizability of the strategy's effects across varying risk levels, for genetic tests versus tests of a nongenetic biomarker, and when using graphic and numeric risk formats. In an internet-based experiment, 749 adults from four countries responded to messages about a hypothetical test for colon cancer risk. Messages varied by Risk-Action Link Information (provision or no provision of information describing how a low-fat diet reduces risk given positive results, indicating presence of a gene fault), Risk Increment (20%, 50%, or 80% risk given positive results), Risk Format (numeric or graphic presentation of risk increments), and Test Type (genetic or enzyme). Providing risk-action link information enhanced beliefs of coherence (understanding how a low-fat diet reduces risk) and response efficacy (low-fat diets effectively reduce risk) and lowered appraisals of anticipated risk of colon cancer given positive results. These effects held across risk increments, risk formats, and test types. For genetic tests, provision of risk-action link information reduced the amount individuals were willing to pay for testing. Brief messages explaining how action can reduce genetic and biomarker-detected risks can promote beliefs motivating protective action. By enhancing understanding of behavioral control, they may reduce the perceived value of genetic risk information. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.\t\t\n",
      "(0.507)  Purpose of review The article discusses recent approaches in the literature about clients who chose to live at risk in their homes. It argues for a positive risk-based approach and a tool to help manage risk in the home, and applies these to a hypothetical end-of-life scenario. Recent findings Historically, safety plans to consider risk management involved a culture of risk aversion supported by sometimes paternalistic motives intended to protect vulnerable clients. New findings in the literature engage in a process that respects the ethical principles underlying harm reduction philosophies. The literature also argues for a perspective that moves away from viewing risk as only harmful, to one that supports a positive understanding of risk as part of a client's informed choice. Summary A risk support management plan, based on a positive approach, can provide a way to both support a client's choice to live at risk, anticipate for expected complications, and inform the creation of a contingency plan to address concerns as they may arise. The added value of a structured approach like the one proposed here for risk support management plans is that it provides adequate due diligence and informed decision-making when planning for risk-taking in complex situations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.507)  Background: Framingham risk equations are widely used to predict cardiovascular disease based on health information from a single time point. Little is known regarding use of information from repeat risk assessments and temporal change in estimated cardiovascular risk for prediction of future cardiovascular events. This study was aimed to compare the discrimination and risk reclassification of approaches using estimated cardiovascular risk at single and repeat risk assessments Methods: Using data on 12,197 individuals enrolled in EPIC-Norfolk cohort, with 12 years of follow-up, we examined rates of cardiovascular events by levels of estimated absolute risk (Framingham risk score) at the first and second health examination four years later. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC) and risk reclassification, comparing approaches using information from single and repeat risk assessments (i.e., estimated risk at different time points). Results: The mean Framingham risk score increased from 15.5% to 17.5% over a mean of 3.7 years from the first to second health examination. Individuals with high estimated risk (=20%) at both health examinations had considerably higher rates of cardiovascular events than those who remained in the lowest risk category (<10%) in both health examinations (34.0 [95%CI 31.7-36.6] and 2.7 [2.2-3.3] per 1,000 person-years respectively). Using information from the most up-to-date risk assessment resulted in a small non-significant change in risk classification over the previous risk assessment (net reclassification improvement of -4.8%, p>0.05). Using information from both risk assessments slightly improved discrimination compared to information from a single risk assessment (aROC 0.76 and 0.75 respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions: Using information from repeat risk assessments over a period of four years modestly improved prediction, compared to using data from a single risk assessment. However, this approach did not improve risk classification. \n",

However, when combining disparate data sources, harmonization projects face data management and analysis challenges. These include differences in the data dictionaries and variable definitions, privacy concerns surrounding health data representing sensitive populations, and lack of properly defined data models. With the availability of mature open-source web-based database technologies, developing a complete software architecture to overcome the challenges associated with the harmonization process can alleviate many roadblocks. By leveraging state-of-the-art software engineering and database principles, we can ensure data quality and enable cross-center online access and collaboration.This paper outlines a complete software architecture developed and customized using the Django web framework, leveraged to harmonize sensitive data collected from three NIH-support birth cohorts.

      "(0.683)  Summary: The public availability of high throughput molecular data provides new opportunities for researchers to advance discovery, replication and validation efforts. One common challenge in leveraging such data is the diversity of measurement approaches and platforms and a lack of utilities enabling cross-platform comparisons among data sources for analysis. We present a method to map DNA methylation data from bisulfite sequencing approaches to CpG sites measured with the widely used Illumina methylation bead-array platforms. Correlations and median absolute deviations support the validity of using bisulfite sequencing data in combination with Illumina bead-array methylation data.\t\t\n",
      "(0.653)  To define the key concepts which inform whether a system for collecting, aggregating and processing routine clinical data for research is fit for purpose. Literature review and shared experiential learning from research using routinely collected data. We excluded socio-cultural issues, and privacy and security issues as our focus was to explore linking clinical data. Six key concepts describe data: (1) Data quality: the core Overarching concept - Are these data fit for purpose? (2) Data provenance: defined as how data came to be; incorporating the concepts of lineage and pedigree. Mapping this process requires metadata. New variables derived during data analysis have their own provenance. (3) Data extraction errors and (4) Data processing errors, which are the responsibility of the investigator extracting the data but need quantifying. (5) Traceability: the capability to identify the origins of any data cell within the final analysis table essential for good governance, and almost impossible without a formal system of metadata; and (6) Curation: storing data and look-up tables in a way that allows future researchers to carry out further research or review earlier findings. There are common distinct steps in processing data; the quality of any metadata may be predictive of the quality of the process. Outputs based on routine data should include a review of the process from data origin to curation and publish information about their data provenance and processing method.\t\t\n",
      "(0.633)  Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.\t\t\n",

Pocket Interview is a configurable electronic diary and data collection tool that provides the ability to design and deliver questionnaires and collect data securely using handheld devices and desktop computers. The client software can be set to prompt the data contributor, via audible prompts, to provide entries at fixed times and preset intervals. The device also allows the users to record personally significant incidents out with the schedule times. Pocket Interview is designed for use, after minimal training, by both the data-provider(s) and the administrator. An administrator can define and/or amend the data they would like to be collected, via a graphical user interface. The system has been shown to be usable by both administrators and users. \n",

      "(0.513)  Managed Care in the U.S. is one of the more controversial strategies to implicitly ration health care. It has also been creeping into Canada where care is similarly being managed albeit in a different socio-political environment. Based on nine group interviews with 35 RNs in California and 10 group interviews with 39 RNs in British Columbia, we find that the price to be paid for the promise of cheaper, more efficient health care through managerial strategies is borne largely by nurses and other health care providers. The data reveal that nurses in British Columbia and California share similar experiences with how the amount of care is rationed at the bedside - through care pathways, early discharge policies and reduced staffing - while the rationing of access to care differs because of the socio-political contexts of their respective health care systems. In both cases, the implicit rationing of care through managerial strategies fails to deliver on its promises.\t\t\n",

      "(0.484)  The long-term care funding system continues to attract much debate in the UK. We produce projections of state and private long-term care expenditure and analyse the distributional impact of state-financed care, through innovative linking of macro- and micro-simulation models. Variant assumptions about life expectancy, dependency and care costs are examined and the impact of universal state-financed ('free') personal care, based on need but not ability to pay, is investigated. We find that future long-term-care expenditure is subject to considerable uncertainty and is particularly sensitive to assumed future trends in real input costs. On a central set of assumptions, free personal' care would, by 2051, increase public spending on long-term care from 1.1 per cent of GDP to 1.3 per cent, or more if it generated an increase in demand. Among the care-home population aged 85 or over, the immediate beneficiaries of free personal care would be those with relatively high incomes.\t\t\n",
      "(0.469)  Policymakers advocate for integrated care as a solution to care fragmentation. In the case of older adults, informal carers (especially dutiful daughters) play a significant role in integrating and coordinating care. Ludlow and colleagues examine how the role of informal carers in integrating care across services and systems is reflected in policy (the blunt-end of the system) and the experiences of dutiful daughters (the sharp-end) in England and Australia. They present the findings from content analysis of key policy documents, as well as four case accounts of dutiful daughters. The authors found that unpaid carers, and the gender imbalance of caregiving, were largely invisible in the policy documents, accentuating the disconnect between policymakers vision for integrated care and the accomplishment of integration on the ground. \n",

      "(0.679)  These are historic times for family medicine. The profession is moving beyond the visionary blueprint of the Future of Family Medicine (FFM) report while working to harness the momentum created by the FFM movement. Preparing for, and leading through, the next transformative wave of change (FFM version 2. 0) will require the engagement of multigenerational and multidisciplinary visionaries who bring wisdom from diverse experiences. Active group reflection on the past will potentiate the collective work being done to best chart the future. Historical competency is critically important for family medicine's future. This article describes the historical context of the development and launch of the FFM report, emphasizing the professional activism that preceded and followed it. This article is intended to spark intergenerational dialog by providing a multigenerational reflection on the history of FFM and the evolution that has occurred in family medicine over the past decade. Such intergenerational conversations enable our elders to share wisdom with our youth, while allowing our discipline to visualize history through the eyes of future generations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.618)  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Family medicine is continuously advanced by a reinforcing research enterprise. In the United States, each national family medicine organization contributes to the disciplines research foundations. We sought to map the unique and interorganizational roles of the eight US family medicine professional organizations participating in Family Medicine for Americas Health (FMAHealth) in supporting family medicine research. METHODS: We interviewed leaders and reviewed supporting materials from organizations participating in FMAHealth. We explored existing activities, capacity, and collaboration. We identified areas of strength and opportunities for growth and synergy with respect to how the family of family medicine nurtures family medicine research. RESULTS: The FMAHealth organizations support certain aspects of the family medicine research infrastructure. Six domains were identified through this work: showcasing scholarship, communication and dissemination, workforce development, data-driven initiatives, performing primary research, and advocacy for family medicine research. Each organizations areas of emphasis differ, but we found substantial collaboration on initiatives across organizations, possibly attributable to the fact that many members belong to more than one organization. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberate contributions to each of the six domains identified herein will be important for the future success of family medicine research. Key opportunity areas described here include coordinated and strategic advocacy for increased funding for family medicine research, dedicated investment in training opportunities, protected effort to grow the next generation of family medicine researchers, pilot funding to build a research base for future high-impact research, and infrastructure to facilitate cross-institutional collaboration and data sharing.\t\t\n",
      "(0.586)  Objectives: The discipline of family medicine seeks to build its research enterprise. To assess the state of family medicine research in the United States, this study identifies and describes research articles published by family medicine researchers from the United States in 2003 and assesses the growth in articles, authors, and publishing journals since 2000. Methods: We searched for all research articles published in 2003 in scholarly, English-language journals authored by individuals in US family medicine organizations and by family physicians from the United States. Search approaches included a hard copy review of 22 journals and Medline searches of articles by family medicine authors and organizations. Similar search approaches, previously reported, were used to identify articles published in 2000. Results: For 2003 we found 790 research articles dispersed across 285 journals from 801 family medicine researcher-authors. Twenty-nine journals published 6 or more family medicine research articles; 159 journals published just 1 research article from the discipline. Family medicine journals published 18% of the discipline's research articles. People in academic departments authored the vast majority (89%) of the discipline's research. Between 2000 and 2003 family medicine's research articles increased by an estimated 58%, its authors increased by 41%, and journals used increased by 82%. Conclusions: Family medicine's research enterprise in the United States is larger and more productive than generally recognized, and it is growing. Nevertheless, family medicine likely publishes fewer research articles than some other clinical disciplines.\t\t\n",
      "(0.543)  The study objectives were to (1) increase our knowledge about family meal patterns of adolescents, (2) identify factors that adolescents perceive as reasons for not eating meals with their family, and (3) assess adolescents' perceptions on whether they eat more healthful foods at family meals than in other eating situations. Focus group discussions were conducted with 141 adolescents from 7th and 10th grade health education classes from urban public junior and senior high schools in Minnesota. Twenty-one focus groups were audio-taped, tapes were transcribed verbatim, transcripts were reviewed for emerging themes, and themes were coded using content analysis procedures. For some adolescents, family meals were part of their daily routine, whereas for others, family meals were not the norm. Diversity also existed with regard to the context of family meals, such as activities during meals and settings for meals. Major reasons for not having meals as a family included parent and teen schedules, teen desire for autonomy, dissatisfaction with family relations, and dislike of food served at family meals. Most of the adolescents thought that they would eat more healthful foods it they ate more often with their families. Key factors that appeared to influence whether participation in family meals would lead to a more healthful diet included food availability at meals, rules around mealtimes, and health-related attitudes of family members. There is great diversity in both the quantity and quality of meals in the families of adolescents. Health care providers working with youth and their families should inquire about family meals and encourage the practice of eating with family members, taking into account what is feasible for a particular family.\t\t\n",
      "(0.532)  Objective To explore the development of family medicine postgraduate training in countries with varying levels of resources at different stages of development of the discipline. Composition of the committee Since 2012, the College of Family Physicians of Canada has hosted the Besrour Conferences to reflect on its role in advancing the discipline of family medicine globally. The Besrour Narrative Working Group was conceived in 2012 at the first Besrour Conference. Their mandate was to use narrative and appreciative inquiry to gather stories of family medicine worldwide. The working group comprised members of various academic departments of family medicine in Canada and abroad who attended the conferences. Methods A consultation process with our partners from lower-middle-income countries was undertaken from 2012 to 2014. Stories were sought from each global partner institute with ties to Canadian family medicine departments. An appreciative inquiry approach was chosen to elicit narratives. Thematic analysis was used to search for common threads and important elements of success that could serve to inform other initiatives in other nations and, in turn, offer hope for greater effect. Report Sixteen narrative stories have been collected so far. These stories highlight insightful solutions, foresight, perseverance, and ultimately a steadfast belief that family medicine will improve the health system and the care provided to the citizens of each nation. Seventeen themes were elucidated by 3 independent Canadian readers. At a subsequent workshop, these themes were validated by Besrour Centre members from Canada and elsewhere. The linkage between the thematic analysis and the experiences of various schools helps to illustrate both the robustness and the usefulness of the narratives in exploring generalizable observations and the features supporting success in each institute. Conclusion If we are to understand, and contribute to, the development of family medicine throughout the world (a key objective of the Besrour Centre), we must begin to hear each others' stories and search for ways in which our collective story can advance the discipline. \n",

      "(0.632)  Background: Randomised trials and their syntheses in meta-analyses offer a unique opportunity to assess the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. Objective: To assess safety reporting in pre-eclampsia trials. Search strategy: Systematic search using bibliographic databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and MEDLINE, from inception to August 2017. Selection criteria: Randomised trials evaluating anticonvulsant or antihypertensive medication for pre-eclampsia. Data collection and analysis: Descriptive statistics appraising the adequacy of adverse reaction and toxicity reporting. Main results: We included 60 randomised trials. Six trials (10%) were registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, two registry records referred to adverse reactions, stating safety and toleration and possible side effects would be collected. Twenty-six trials (43%) stated the frequency of withdrawals within each study arm, and five trials (8%) adequately reported these withdrawals. Adverse reactions were inconsistently reported across eligible trials: 24 (40%) reported no serious adverse reactions and 36 (60%) reported no mild adverse reactions. The methods of definition or measurement of adverse reactions were infrequently reported within published trial reports. Conclusions: Pre-eclampsia trials regularly omit critical information related to safety. Despite the paucity of reporting, randomised trials collect an enormous amount of safety data. Developing and implementing a minimum data set could help to improve safety reporting, permitting a more balanced assessment of interventions by considering the trade-off between the benefits and harms.

      "(0.574)  Introduction: In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, HIV-related diarrhea remains common. There is no gold standard to measure diarrhea, making comparison across trials difficult. We conducted a systematic review to determine current research practice in measuring HIV-related diarrhea. Method: MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 2006 for clinical trials of treatment for HIV-related diarrhea. The following data were abstracted: type of trial, treatment studied, definition of diarrhea, and definition of improvement in diarrhea. Results: We reviewed 384 articles; 46 met our inclusion criteria. Forty-two trials were prospective: 25 were open-label and 17 were controlled trials. Antimicrobials were studied most often (15 trials): octreotide was studied in 10 trials, and HAART in 5. Presence of diarrhea was most often defined by duration (33 trials, 72%), stool frequency (29 trials, 63%), and/or stool form (23 trials, 50%); often, more than one parameter was used. Stool frequency was used most often to measure diarrhea improvement (28 trials, 61 %). Only one trial used a measure validated for HIV-related diarrhea. Conclusion: Investigators rely on nonvalidated and disparate measures of HIV-related diarrhea. An easy-to-use, well-accepted, and valid tool to measure HIV-related diarrhea would enhance research in this field. © 2007 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.562)  Background: We would expect information on adverse drug reactions in randomised clinical trials to be easily retrievable from specific searches of electronic databases. However, complete retrieval of such information may not be straightforward, for two reasons. First, not all clinical drug trials provide data on the frequency of adverse effects. Secondly, not all electronic records of trials include terms in the abstract or indexing fields that enable us to select those with adverse effects data. We have determined how often automated search methods, using indexing terms and/or textwords in the title or abstract, would fail to retrieve trials with adverse effects data. Methods: We used a sample set of 107 trials known to report frequencies of adverse drug effects, and measured the proportion that (i) were not assigned the appropriate adverse effects indexing terms in the electronic databases, and (ii) did not contain identifiable adverse effects textwords in the title or abstract. Results: Of the 81 trials with records on both MEDLINE and EMBASE, 25 were not indexed for adverse effects in either database. Twenty-six trials were indexed in one database but not the other. Only 66 of the 107 trials reporting adverse effects data mentioned this in the abstract or title of the paper. Simultaneous use of textword and indexing terms retrieved only 82/107 (77%) papers. Conclusions: Specific search strategies based on adverse effects textwords and indexing terms will fail to identify nearly a quarter of trials that report on the rate of drug adverse effects.\t\t\n",
      "(0.55)  Background: Analysis of trial documentation has revealed that some industry-funded trials may be done more for marketing purposes than scientific endeavour. We aimed to define characteristics of drug trials that appear to be influenced by marketing considerations and estimate their prevalence. Methods: We examined reports of randomised controlled trials of drugs published in six general medical journals in 2011. Six investigators independently reviewed all publications, characterising them as YES/MAYBE/NO suspected marketing trials, and then met to reach consensus. Blinded researchers then extracted key trial characteristics. We used blinded cluster analysis to determine if key variables could characterise the categories of trials (YES/MAYBE/NO). Results: 41/194 (21 %) trials were categorised as YES, 14 (7 %) as MAYBE, 139 (72 %) as NO. All YES and MAYBE trials were funded by the manufacturer, compared with 37 % of NO trials (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of YES trials had authors or contributors from the manufacturer involved in study design (83 % vs. 19 %), data analysis (85 % vs.15 %) and reporting (81 % vs. 15 %) than NO trials (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in the median number of participants screened (p = 0.49), but the median number of centres recruiting participants was higher for YES compared with NO trials (171 vs. 13, p < 0.001). YES trials were not more likely to use a surrogate (42 % vs. 30 %; p = 0.38) or composite primary outcome measure (34 % vs. 19 %; p = 0.14) than NO trials. YES trials were often better reported in terms of blinding, safety outcomes and adverse events than NO trials. YES trials more frequently included speculation that might encourage clinicians to use the intervention outside of the study population compared to NO trials (59 % vs.37 %, p = 0.03). Cluster analysis based on study characteristics did not identify a clear variable structure that accurately characterised YES/MAYBE/NO trials. Conclusions: We reached consensus that a fifth of drug trials published in the highest impact general medical journals in 2011 had features that were suggestive of being designed for marketing purposes. Each of the marketing trials appeared to have a unique combination of features reported in the journal publications.\t\t\n",
      "(0.531)  Clinical trials present an ethical dilemma for pharmaceutical companies. While companies may want to undertake and report these trials in an ethical manner, negative results can significantly affect product sales. There is accumulating evidence that company-financed trials are biased in favor of the product that the company makes. Ethical conduct in this article is defined as whether the trials are conducted in the best interests of the participants and/or reported in the best interests of patients. Nine examples of how clinical trials are violating multiple articles in the Declaration of Helsinki are discussed using concrete case reports from the literature. The recognition of ethical problems in company run trials is not something new, but to date no meaningful action has been taken to resolve this issue. What is necessary is to separate the financing of clinical trials from their conduct. © 2013 Lexchin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \n",

      "(0.887)  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the ability to collect blood pressure readings several times an hour across a 24-hour period. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring facilitates the identification of whitecoat hypertension, the phenomenon whereby certain individuals who are not taking antihypertensive medication show elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but show nonelevated blood pressure averages when assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In addition, readings can be segmented into time windows of particular interest, for example, mean daytime and nighttime values. During sleep, blood pressure typically decreases, or dips, such that mean sleep blood pressure is lower than mean awake blood pressure. A nondipping pattern and nocturnal hypertension are strongly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 70% of individuals have blood pressure dips of =10% at night, whereas 30% have nondipping patterns, when blood pressure remains similar to daytime average or occasionally increases above daytime average. The various blood pressure categorizations afforded by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are valuable for clinical management of high blood pressure because they increase the accuracy for diagnosis and the prediction of cardiovascular risk.\t\t\n",
      "(0.839)  Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·979·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·977·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% (21·427·1) in men and 20·1% (17·822·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

      "(0.824)  OBJECTIVE: We tested the accuracy of the HEM-780REL automatic blood pressure monitor with Easy Wrap Cuff. METHODS: We used the International Protocol for validation of blood pressure measuring devices developed by the Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring of the European Society of Hypertension. Thirty-three adults over the age of 30 years participated to have 11 total participants in each of the three required blood pressure ranges for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Sequential blood pressure readings were taken independently by trained observers using a mercury standard with appropriate size cuff. A third observer performed measurements with the test device. Analyses were performed according to International Protocol specifications for the 99 pairs of measurements. The device was given a pass/fail recommendation based on bands of accuracy compared with the mercury standard (within 5, 10, or 15 mmHg), as well as number of readings per participant within 5 mmHg. RESULTS: The mean blood pressure difference was 0.52±7.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 0.39±4.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twenty-four out of 33 participants had two out of three readings within 5 mmHg of the mercury standard for systolic blood pressure. Twenty-seven out of 33 participants had two out of three readings within 5 mmHg of the mercury standard for diastolic blood pressure. The device received a passing grade both for accuracy of individual measurements and for accuracy for individuals. CONCLUSION: The HEM-780REL with Easy Wrap Cuff performs accurately according to the standards of the International Protocol. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.819)  We have assessed the association between excessive orthostatic changes in blood pressure and risk of incident heart failure (HF) in older, community-dwelling men. This was a prospective cohort study of 3505 men (mean age, 68.5 years), who did not have prevalent HF, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Excessive orthostatic change in blood pressure was defined continuously and categorically as orthostatic hypotension (sitting-to-standing decrease in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), systolic orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure =20 mm Hg, diastolic orthostatic hypertension as diastolic blood pressure =10 mm Hg), and orthostatic normotension (neither orthostatic hypotension nor orthostatic hypertension). There was a U-shaped association between orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and the risk of incident HF; for diastolic blood pressure, only its fall predicted HF. After adjustment for possible confounders, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for incident HF was 1.65 (1.24-2.18) in men with orthostatic hypotension and 0.90 (0.65-1.24) and 1.88 (1.30-2.73) in men with diastolic and systolic orthostatic hypertension, respectively. Both components of orthostatic hypotension were associated with increased risk, although the systolic component was more predictive than the diastolic component. Both orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension are associated with risk of incident HF in older men. Our findings suggest that orthostatic hypertension is defined by a rise beyond threshold in systolic blood pressure only. Further prospective studies in diverse cohorts are needed to confirm our findings.\t\t\n",
      "(0.818)  Office blood pressure measurement has been the basis for hypertension evaluation for almost a century. However, the evaluation of blood pressure out of the office using ambulatory or self-home monitoring is now strongly recommended for the accurate diagnosis in many, if not all, cases with suspected hypertension. Moreover, there is evidence that the variability of blood pressure might offer prognostic information that is independent of the average blood pressure level. Recently, advancement in technology has provided noninvasive evaluation of central (aortic) blood pressure, which might have attributes that are additive to the conventional brachial blood pressure measurement. This position statement, developed by international experts, deals with key research and practical issues in regard to peripheral blood pressure measurement (office, home, and ambulatory), blood pressure variability, and central blood pressure measurement. The objective is to present current achievements, identify gaps in knowledge and issues concerning clinical application, and present relevant research questions and directions to investigators and manufacturers for future research and development (primary goal). \n",

      "(0.686)  In South Africa, economic liberalization and the technological innovations in the mining sector have altered employment opportunities for rural Xhosa. Young men struggle to find jobs as labor migrants, while some young women find work in villages. These women assume provider roles for their families that are reminiscent of longstanding normative masculine achievements. They also use their income to achieve relative independence. Although many households depend on working women, they nevertheless attract criticism. Women mobilize a discourse of human rights to defend their position in these conflicts, even as men argue that human rights enable womens wayward behaviour. Drawing on fieldwork in the Eastern Cape, this article argues that working women provoke controversy because of how they trouble gendered meanings attached to work, domesticity, and social reproduction. I show that although they challenge the patriarchal domestic order through lifestyle choices and overt appeals to the right to remain single, the strategies that working women deploy to manage conflicting expectations and a heavy workload also reproduce patriarchal domestic hierarchies. In so doing, they further exclude young men from social reproduction. By situating their struggle in a discursive framework of human rights, single women find ways of occupying seemingly contradictory positions simultaneously.\t\t\n",
      "(0.568)  The starting place for this essay is Knupfer and Room's insight that more restrictive norms around drinking and intoxication tend to be selectively applied to the economically dependent segments of society, such as women. However, since these authors wrote in 1964, women in the US and many other societies around the globe have experienced rising economic independence. The essay considers how the moral categories of acceptable drinking and drunkenness may have shifted alongside women's rising economic independence, and looks at evidence on the potential consequences for women's health and wellbeing. I argue that, as women have gained economic independence, changes in drinking norms have produced two different kinds of negative unintended consequences for women at high and low extremes of economic spectrum. As liberated women of the middle and upper classes have become more economically equal to men, they have enjoyed the right to drink with less restraint. For them, alongside the equal right to drink has come greater equality in exposure to alcohol-attributable harms, abuse and dependence. I further suggest that, as societies become more liberated, the economic dependency of low-income women is brought into greater question. Under such conditions, women in poverty-particularly those economically dependent on the state, such as welfare mothers-have become subject to more restrictive norms around drinking and intoxication, and more punitive social controls.

      "(0.567)  Women of lower socioeconomic status and women of color in the United States have higher rates of abortion than women of higher socioeconomic status and White women. Opponents of abortion use these statistics to argue that abortion providers are exploiting women of color and low socioeconomic status, and thus, regulations are needed to protect women. This argument ignores the underlying causes of the disparities. As efforts to restrict abortion will have no effect on these underlying factors, and instead will only result in more women experiencing later abortions or having an unintended childbirth, they are likely to result in worsening health disparities. We provide a review of the causes of abortion disparities and argue for a multifaceted public health approach to address them.\t\t\n",
      "(0.545)  Background: It is not known if lower uptake of prenatal screening for Down syndrome in women from minority ethnic groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged women reflects more negative attitudes towards undergoing the test or women not acting in line with their attitudes i.e. not making an informed choice. Methods: Uptake of prenatal screening, attitudes towards undergoing the test, uptake-attitude consistency, and informed choice were assessed in a prospective study of 1499 pregnant women attending two UK hospitals. Results: Uptake was higher in white and socioeconomically advantaged women than in other women. There were no differences in attitudes towards undergoing the test; all women expressed relatively positive attitudes. Uptake-attitude consistency was higher in white and socioeconomically advantaged women than others, particularly in those with positive attitudes towards undergoing the test (76% white women with positive attitudes had the test compared with 45% South Asian women [difference 31%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 18-43] and 78% socioeconomically advantaged women compared with 63% more disadvantaged women (difference 15%, 95% CI 7-24)). Controlling for demographic variables, South Asian and socioeconomically disadvantaged women with positive attitudes were less likely to make an informed choice than other women [odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.45 and OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93, respectively]. Conclusion: Lower uptake of screening for Down syndrome in women from minority ethnic groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged women does not reflect more negative attitudes towards screening but rather lower rates of informed choice, as assessed in this study. Healthcare systems appear to facilitate informed choices in the context of prenatal screening for Down syndrome screening less well for women from minority ethnic groups and those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged than for other women. © The Author 2005; all rights reserved.\t\t\n",

The survey took account of methodological and ethical recommendations, ensuring privacy of interviews through one person interviewing the mother-in-law while another interviewed the eligible woman privately. The training module for interviewers focused on empathy with respondents, notably increasing disclosure rates. Only 3% of women declined to participate, and 1% were not permitted to participate. Among women who disclosed physical violence, only one third had previously told anyone.

      "(0.79)  Pain care for hospitalized patients is often suboptimal. Representing pain scores as a graphical trajectory may provide insights into the understanding and treatment of pain. We describe a 1-year, retrospective, observational study to characterize pain trajectories of hospitalized adults during the first 48 hours after admission at an urban academic medical center. Using a subgroup of patients who presented with significant pain (pain score >4; n 7762 encounters), we characterized pain trajectories and measured area under the curve, slope of the trajectory for the first 2 hours after admission, and pain intensity at plateau. We used mixed-effects regression to assess the association between pain score and sociodemographics (age, race, and gender), pain medication orders (opioids, nonopioids, and no medications), and medical service (obstetrics, psychiatry, surgery, sickle cell, intensive care unit, and medicine). K-means clustering was used to identify patient subgroups with similar trajectories. Trajectories showed differences based on race, gender, service, and initial pain score. Patients presumed to have dissimilar pain experiences (eg, sickle vs obstetrical) had markedly different pain trajectories. Patients with higher initial pain had a more rapid reduction during their first 2 hours of treatment. Pain reduction achieved in the 48 hours after admission was approximately 50% of the initial pain, regardless of the initial pain. Most patients' pain failed to fully resolve, plateauing at a pain score of 4 or greater. Visualizing pain scores as graphical trajectories illustrates the dynamic variability in pain, highlighting pain responses over a period of observation, and may yield new insights for quality improvement and research.\t\t\n",
      "(0.79)  Objectives: To examine sex differences pertaining to pain characteristics in patients presenting to the ambulatory emergency department (ED) with nontraumatic chest pain and to the prediction of exercise-induced ischemia on a follow-up electrocardiogram. Methods: This was a prospective study of 131 women and 202 men (mean age 58 years) consulting the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. Seventy-eight women and 116 men underwent exercise stress testing following the ED consultation. Chest pain location, extension, intensity and quality were measured. Chest pain was classified as nonspecific, or typical or atypical of angina. Results: Women received fewer 'typical' angina pain diagnoses (P<0.05), rated their pain as more intense (P<0.05) and used more affective words to describe their pain (P<0.05) compared with men. Pain in the posterior shoulder and middle back areas were more frequently reported by women (P<0.05). The presence of pain in the right anterior and posterior shoulder, as well as the absence of pain in the left anterior shoulder, predicted ischemia (P<0.05) in both men and women. Only in men, pain in the retrosternal and right middle back areas, as well as a classification of pain as typical or atypical, further contributed to the prediction of ischemia. Conclusions: Sex differences exist in the experience of chest pain and in the prediction of exercise-induced ischemia from pain variables. Further research on the unique symptomatology of men and women is needed to optimize their medical management.\t\t\n",
      "(0.785)  We have examined the characteristics of the pain experience as well as barriers to optimal pain management in 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) consecutively attending a specialist rheumatology practice. Pain was reported to be moderate to severe in 32 (53%) and mild to absent in 28 (47%). Sixty-five percent of all patients, including almost half of those with moderate to severe pain, reported satisfaction with current pain control. The average number of barriers to pain management for individual patients was 2.6 ± 1.5, with 33 patients (55%) reporting 3 or more barriers. Specific barriers included concern about side effects of medications in 80%, dislike for \"too many pills\" in 63%, concern about drug interactions in 57%, fear of addiction in 35%, and fear of masking disease in 27% of the patients. More barriers were significantly associated with higher pain level (r = .33, P = .011) and pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (r = .29, P = .024). Other than the regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 37% of the patients and acetaminophen in 37%, analgesics or other modalities to reduce pain were seldom used. Perspective: Moderate to severe pain was present in over half of patients with RA with many reporting the presence of considerable barriers to pain control. These barriers likely contribute to sub optimal pain management. RA patients tolerate pain and use limited mechanisms to deal with the symptom of pain. © 2009 American Pain Society.\t\t\n",
      "(0.785)  Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of diagnostic codes recorded in the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) administrative database for identifying patients suffering from various types of chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: The validity of published International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coding algorithms for identifying patients with particular chronic pain syndromes in the RAMQ database was tested using pain specialist-established diagnostic data of 561 patients enrolled in the Quebec Pain Registry, which was used as the reference standard. Modified versions of these algorithms (i.e., adaptation of the number of healthcare encounters) were also tested. For each algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results: In the RAMQ database, some previously published algorithms and modified versions of these algorithms were found to be valid for identifying patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain (sensitivity: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.59-0.71; specificity: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.79-0.87), chronic back pain (sensitivity: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.64-0.76; specificity: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.68-0.78), and chronic neck/back pain (sensitivity: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.65-0.76; specificity: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.72-0.82). Algorithms to identify patients with other types of chronic pain showed low sensitivity: complex regional pain syndrome (=0.07), fibromyalgia (=0.42), and neuropathic pain (=0.39). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence supporting the value of the RAMQ administrative database for conducting research on certain types of chronic pain disorders including back and neck pain. Users should, however, be cautious about the limitations of this database for studying other types of chronic pain syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain.\t\t\n",
      "(0.78)  Failure to appreciate how pain arises in tendinopathies may be limiting medical progress. It is assumed that tendon overuse causes inflammation, and thus pain. We critically review the inflammatory model of pain in tendinopathy and find that it does not withstand scrutiny. The generally proposed alternative model is that of mechanical discontinuity of collagen fibers, but this as well is inconsistent with numerous surgical observations. We review data suggesting that pain of tendinopathy may be largely due to yet unidentified biochemical factors activating peritendinous nociceptors when they are exposed to the environs as a result of tendon overuse injury. The noxious agent could include matrix substances and minor collagens. Glutamate can mediate pain, and this is present in higher concentrations in subjects with Achilles tendinopathy than in controls. Chondroitin sulphate is another candidate. Examining alternative models of pain, particularly a mixed biochemical-mechanical model, may allow significant progress in management of these troublesome conditions. \n",

We surveyed 201 orthopedic surgeons, 141 rheumatologists, and 455 family physicians. Physicians were asked how 34 patient characteristics affected their decision to perform or refer for knee arthroplasty. Surgeons and referring physicians agreed on how 4 and 2 of 34 patient characteristics affected their decision about knee arthroplasty, respectively. Half of the variability in opinion among physicians could be accounted for by inconsistency in their individual responses to the survey 6 weeks apart (mean intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.49). Although surgeons and referring physicians vary in their opinion, half of the variability could be attributed to individual physician inconsistency. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.536)  The extent to which physicians lead, own, and govern accountable care organizations (ACOs) is unknown. However, physicians' involvement in ACOs will influence how clinicians and patients perceive the ACO model, how effective these organizations are at improving quality and costs, and how future ACOs will be organized. From October 2012 to May 2013 we fielded the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations, the first such survey of public and private ACOs. We found that 51 percent of ACOs were physician-led, with another 33 percent jointly led by physicians and hospitals. In 78 percent of ACOs, physicians constituted a majority of the governing board, and physicians owned 40 percent of ACOs. The broad reach of physician leadership has important implications for the future evolution of ACOs. It seems likely that the challenge of fundamentally changing care delivery as the country moves away from fee-for-service payment will not be accomplished without strong, effective leadership from physicians. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.53)  While pay for performance (P4P) has created a nationwide buzz among health plans, physicians and hospitals, most P4P initiatives are still on the drawing board, according to findings from the Center for Studying Health System Change's (HSC) 2005 site visits to 12 nationally representative communities. HSC focused on performance-based payment for physicians, finding that only two HSC communities-Orange County, Calif., and Boston-have significant physician P4P programs. In the other 10 communities, where almost no physicians have received quality-related payments to date, physician attitudes about P4P ranged from skeptical to hostile. P4P, a concept best suited to larger physician groups, may be difficult to implement in markets dominated by small physician practices. In spite of substantial barriers to initiating performance-related payment for physicians, most large health plans and Medicare are planning P4P programs.\t\t\n",
      "(0.439)  Physician supply in the U.S. is again on the national health policy agenda. A central issue in this debate is the availability of physicians willing to work in underserved and disadvantaged communities-an issue closely linked to the number of minority and international medical graduate (IMG) physicians working in the U.S. In California, South Asian IMGs, but not South Asian U.S. medical graduates, are more likely to work in underserved communities. Incorporation of strong policy levers aimed at an equitable geographic distribution of physicians will be critical as the U.S. moves toward greater self-sufficiency of physician supply. More specifically, the authors note the continuing central importance to addressing the needs of medically underserved populations of training physicians from under-represented minority groups (African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanic Americans) in U.S. medical schools.\t\t\n",
      "(0.427)  Purpose: Recognition of the importance and difficulty of engaging physicians in organisational change has sparked an explosion of literature. The social identity approach, by considering engagement in terms of underlying group identifications and intergroup dynamics, may provide a framework for choosing among the plethora of proposed engagement techniques. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined how four disparate organisations engaged physicians in change. Qualitative methods included interviews (109 managers and physicians), observation, and document review. Findings: Beyond a universal focus on relationship-building, sites differed radically in their preferred strategies. Each emphasised or downplayed professional and/or organisational identity as befit the existing level of inter-group closeness between physicians and managers: an independent practice association sought to enhance members' identity as independent physicians; a hospital, engaging community physicians suspicious of integration, stressed collaboration among separate, equal partners; a developing integrated-delivery system promoted alignment among diverse groups by balancing \"systemness\" with subgroup uniqueness; a medical group established a strong common identity among employed physicians, but practised pragmatic co-operation with its affiliates. Research limitations/implications: The authors cannot confirm the accuracy of managers' perceptions of the inter-group context or the efficacy of particular strategies. Nonetheless, the findings suggested the fruitfulness of social identity thinking in approaching physician engagement. Practical implications: Attention to inter-group dynamics may help organisations engage physicians more effectively. Originality/value: This study illuminates and explains variation in the way different organisations engage physicians, and offers a theoretical basis for selecting engagement strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. \n",

      "(0.813)  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging measurements of cartilage tissuemimicking phantoms and to determine a combination of magnetic resonance imaging parameters to optimize accuracy while minimizing scan time. METHOD: Edge dimensions from 4 rectangular agar phantoms ranging from 10.5 to 14.5 mm in length and 1.25 to 5.5 mm in width were independently measured by two readers using a steel ruler. Coronal T1 spin echo (T1 SE), fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo (FSPGR) and multiplanar gradient-recalled echo (GRE MPGR) sequences were used to obtain phantom images on a 1.5-T scanner. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-reader reliability were high for both direct measurements and for magnetic resonance imaging measurements of phantoms. Statistically significant differences were noted between the mean direct measurements and the mean magnetic resonance imaging measurements for phantom 1 when using a GRE MPGR sequence (512x512 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 5: 49 min scan time), while borderline differences were noted for T1 SE sequences with the following parameters: 320x320 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 6: 11 min scan time; 320x320 pixels, 4-mm slice thickness, 6: 11 min scan time; and 512x512 pixels, 1.5-mm slice thickness, 9: 48 min scan time. Borderline differences were also noted when using a FSPGR sequence with 512x512 pixels, a 1.5-mm slice thickness and a 3: 36 min scan time. CONCLUSIONS: FSPGR sequences, regardless of the magnetic resonance imaging parameter combination used, provided accurate measurements. The GRE MPGR sequence using 512x512 pixels, a 1.5-mm slice thickness and a 5: 49 min scan time and, to a lesser degree, all tested T1 SE sequences produced suboptimal accuracy when measuring the widest phantom.\t\t\n",
      "(0.721)  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union provides for an extension of Canadian patents for prescription drugs by up to 2 years. One of the arguments advanced for longer patent time is to compensate companies for the length of the overall drug development time (the time between patent application and market approval). This study investigates overall development time in Canada for different groups of drugs approved between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018 and how many of these drugs are eligible for up to 2 years of patent term extension. Based on a list of patents and dates of market approval, the change in overall development time for all drugs was calculated along with whether there were differences in development time between different groups of drugs. Using Canadian patent filing dates, overall development time for all drugs went from a mean of 2240 days (95% CI: 1832, 2648) in 2009 to 4197 days (95% CI: 3728, 4665) in 2018 (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < .0001). Using first global patent filing dates, overall development time went from a mean of 4481 days (95% CI: 3053, 5908) in 2009 to 6298 days (95% CI: 4839, 7756) in 2018 (ANOVA, P = .0118). There was a statistically significant difference in the overall development mean time between small molecule drugs (3553, 95% CI: 3361, 3746) and biologics (3903, 95% CI: 3595, 4212), (t test, P = .0487) when using Canadian patent filing dates but not when first global patent filing dates were used. There was no statistically significant change in overall development time among drugs that were substantial, moderate or little to none additional therapeutic value compared to existing drugs. Out of 238 drugs, 218 (91.6%) would have been eligible for patent term extension with 195 (80.7%) eligible for the full 2 years. Patent term extension does not appear to be justified based on changes in overall development time, except possibly in the case of biologics. There are also trade offs in terms of increased expenditures that need to be considered if patent terms are lengthened.\t\t\n",
      "(0.662)  PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and absolute agreement of a self-report, last 7-d sedentary behavior questionnaire (SIT-Q-7d), which assesses total daily sedentary time as an aggregate of sitting/lying down in five domains (meals, transportation, occupation, nonoccupational screen time, and other sedentary time). Dutch (DQ) and English (EQ) versions of the questionnaire were examined. METHODS: Fifty-one Flemish adults (ages 39.4 ± 11.1 yr) wore a thigh accelerometer (activPAL3) and simultaneously kept a domain log for 7 d. The DQ was subsequently completed twice (median test-retest interval: 3.3 wk). Thigh-acceleration sedentary time was log annotated to create comparable domain-specific and total sedentary time variables. Four hundred two English adults (ages 49.6 ± 7.3 yr) wore a combined accelerometer and HR monitor (Actiheart) for 6 d to objectively measure total sedentary time. The EQ was subsequently completed twice (median test-retest interval: 3.4 wk). In both samples, the questionnaire reference frame overlapped with the criterion measure administration period. All participants had five or more valid days of criterion data, including one or more weekend day. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI)) was fair to good for total sedentary time (DQ: 0.68 (0.50-0.81); EQ: 0.53 (0.44-0.62)) and poor to excellent for domain-specific sedentary time (DQ: from 0.36 (0.10-0.57) (meals) to 0.66 (0.46-0.79) (occupation); EQ: from 0.45 (0.35-0.54) (other sedentary time) to 0.76 (0.71-0.81) (meals)). For criterion validity (Spearman rho), significant correlations were found for total sedentary time (DQ: 0.52; EQ: 0.22; all P <0.001). Compared with domain-specific criterion variables (DQ), modest-to-strong correlations were found for domain-specific sedentary time (from 0.21 (meals) to 0.76 (P < 0.001) (screen time)). The questionnaire generally overestimated sedentary time compared with criterion measures. CONCLUSION: The SIT-Q-7d appears to be a useful tool for ranking individuals in large-scale observational studies examining total and domain-specific sitting. © 2014 by the American College of Sports Medicine.\t\t\n",
      "(0.585)  Introduction: American Indian children have high rates of overweight and obesity, which may be partially attributable to screen-time behavior. Young children's screen-time behavior is strongly influenced by their environment and their parents' behavior. We explored whether parental television watching time, parental perceptions of children's screen time, and media-related resources in the home are related to screen time (ie, television, DVD/video, video game, and computer use) among Oglala Lakota youth residing on or near the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Methods: We collected baseline data from 431 child and parent/caregiver pairs who participated in Bright Start, a group-randomized, controlled, school-based obesity prevention trial to reduce excess weight gain. Controlling for demographic characteristics, we used linear regression analysis to assess associations between children's screen time and parental television watching time, parental perceptions of children's screen time, and availability of media-related household resources. Results: The most parsimonious model for explaining child screen time included the children's sex, parental body mass index, parental television watching time, how often the child watched television after school or in the evening, parental perception that the child spent too much time playing video games, how often the parent limited the child's television time, and the presence of a VCR/DVD player or video game player in the home (F 7,367 = 14.67; P < .001; adjusted R 2 = .37). The presence of a television in the bedroom did not contribute significantly to the model. Conclusion: Changes in parental television watching time, parental influence over children's screen-time behavior, and availability of media-related resources in the home could decrease screen time and may be used as a strategy for reducing overweight and obesity in American Indian children.\t\t\n",
      "(0.584)  Introduction Studies of the delay between when companies file a New Drug Submission (NDS) and when drugs reach Canadian patients typically focus on the time in the regulatory review process and do not analyze the time between when approval is granted and the drug is available for purchase (company decision time). This study looks at the length of the two different time periods. Secondarily, it examines whether there is a difference in these time periods for drugs that received a standard review and those that received an expedited review. Methods A list of all New Active Substances approved in Canada between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 was compiled and the dates when the companies applied for a NDS, the dates when the drugs received a market authorization (Notice of Compliance, NOC) and whether the drugs received a standard review or an expedited review were recorded. The date of original marketing comes from Health Canada's Drug Product Database. Times in days were calculated between NDS and NOC (review time), between NOC and the marketing date (company decision time) and between NDS and the marketing date (total time). The company decision time as a percent of the total time was calculated for all drugs. Times were compared between standard and expedited review drugs using a twotailed t-test. Results One hundred and fifty-seven drugs were analyzed, 98 had a standard review and 59 had a priority review. Over 18% of the total time was due to company decisions. All three times were significantly lower for expedited review drugs versus standard review drugs as was the percent of total time due to company decision- 14.4% (95% CI 11.0, 17.8) versus 21.2% (95% CI 17.6, 24.8), p = 0.0102 (t-test). Conclusions Over 18% of the total time between when companies file for drug approval until the drug is available is due to decisions made by companies. Company decision times are shorter for drugs with expedited approvals compared to drugs with standard approvals. \n",

      "(0.873)  People with dementia have problems carrying out multi-step tasks such as making a hot drink. Intelligent systems are being built to prompt people through such tasks. However, the prompts used by these systems are likely to be viewed as novel. As people with dementia are known to be sensitive to novelty this could be a problem. An experiment was performed to determine how to prompt people with dementia with which knob controls which burner on a cooking range. A highly novel implicit attentional cue using fluorescent wire was found to provide comparable or better results than more conventional alternatives. It is concluded that design in this area does not need to be constrained by the need to avoid novelty. The experiment is also of interest because of the way that it was embedded in a natural cooking task suitable for people of varied cognitive capacity.\t\t\n",
      "(0.699)  Purpose - There is a discrepancy between the ease of purchase of cigarettes reported by young people themselves and the results of ease of purchase obtained by tests done by official sources such as Trading Standards Units. This discrepancy suggests that either data from young people or from trading standards are unreliable. This research set out to find out whether young peoples' perceptions of easy purchasing from shops were true. Design/methodology/approach - Six volunteer young people visited shops around the West Midlands region and attempted to buy cigarettes. They conducted the attempt in as realistic fashion as possible. All volunteers were assessed independently as looking under 16. Shopkeeper, shop, area and youth attributes were recorded Findings - Young people were able to make purchases in 31 out of 38 shops. The young people were very surprised by their rates of successful purchase attempts across such a large geographical area. Practical implications - Shopkeepers and communities need to be given more help to recognise underage youth purchasers in order to reduce this important source of tobacco to young people. Trading standards protocols for test purchases need to be revised to reflect the reality of ease of purchasing for young people. Originality/value - This research confirms that young people who say that it is possible to buy cigarettes from shops appear to generally be correct in their perceptions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\t\t\n",
      "(0.611)  After a sudden traumatic death, bereaved relatives may feel particularly distressed. We look at the role of spirituality (including religion, whether following communal forms or more individually expressed) in people's lives after the traumatic death of a relative. Our findings are based on narrative interviews with 40 people bereaved through murder, manslaughter, car crash, train accident, fire, bomb explosion, industrial explosion, or pedestrian incident. People were interviewed in their homes throughout the UK. A qualitative interpretive approach was taken, combining thematic analysis with constant comparison. A few people said that after the death they felt angry or cynical about religion, but many people turned to spirituality or religion for help at this time. People reported that through spirituality or religion they found practical support, comfort, help in making sense of what had happened, belief in continued existence beyond death, a way of ensuring 'continuing bonds', and healing. Despite declining church attendance and a decline in the number of people who call themselves Christians, it seems that in the UK religion still remains important for people bereaved by a traumatic death. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.\t\t\n",
      "(0.526)  Improving access to culturally-appropriate services and enhancing responses to the needs of older people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were among the aims of the National Service Framework for Older People (NSFOP) that was introduced in England in 2001. Progress in meeting the aims of the NSFOP was evaluated by a mid-term independent review led by the Healthcare Commission, the body responsible for regulating health-care services in England. This paper reports the consultation with older people that underpinned the evaluation. It focuses on the views and experiences of older people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups and of the staff that work in BME voluntary organisations. A rapid appraisal approach was used in 10 purposively selected local councils, and plural methods were used, including public listening events, nominal groups and individual interviews. In total 1,839 older people participated in the consultations and 1,280 (70%) completed a monitoring form. Some 30 per cent defined themselves as of a minority ethnic background. The concerns were more about the low recognition of culturally-specific and language needs than for the development of services exclusively for BME older people. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.\t\t\n",
      "(0.497)  There is growing interest in the social geography of dementia, with the development of dementia-friendly communities, localities and cities in the developed world. This paper considers the claims being made for cities to be risky spaces for people with dementia. It debates this through an analysis based on Bacchis representation of problems framework, evidencing this with policy documents and research findings. This reveals that the city is often seen as problematic for people with dementia, despite evidence to the contrary, and that local politicians are making claims for cities to be responsive dementia communities. The nature of local political ambitions is illustrated by strategies from London and from Manchester in the UK. \n",

      "(0.765)  Natural Killer (NK) cell responses to HIV-infected CD4 T cells (iCD4) depend on the integration of signals received through inhibitory (iNKR) and activating NK receptors (aNKR). iCD4 activate NK cells to inhibit HIV replication. HIV infection-dependent changes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands for iNKR on iCD4 are well documented. By contrast, less is known regarding the HIV infection related changes in ligands for aNKR on iCD4. We examined the aNKR ligand profiles HIV p24+ HIV iCD4s that maintained cell surface CD4 (iCD4+), did not maintain CD4 (iCD4-) and uninfected CD4 (unCD4) T cells for expression of unique long (UL)-16 binding proteins-1 (ULBP-1), ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1-related (MIC)-A, MIC-B, CD48, CD80, CD86, CD112, CD155, Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-A2, HLA-C, and the ligands to NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DS1 (KIR3DS1) by flow cytometry on CD4 T cells from 17 HIV-1 seronegative donors activated and infected with HIV. iCD4+ cells had higher expression of aNKR ligands than did unCD4. However, the expression of aNKR ligands on iCD4 where CD4 was downregulated (iCD4-) was similar to (ULBP-1, ULBP-2/5/6, ULBP-3, MIC-A, CD48, CD80, CD86 and CD155) or significantly lower than (MIC-B, CD112 and ICAM-2) what was observed on unCD4. Thus, HIV infection can be associated with increased expression of aNKR ligands or either baseline or lower than baseline levels of aNKR ligands, concomitantly with the HIV-mediated downregulation of cell surface CD4 on infected cells.\t\t\n",
      "(0.727)  Quebecs HIV epidemic persists, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and in Montreal. Increasing access to HIV testing is necessary and community-based rapid testing offers one strategy. This paper examines the clienteles and activities of a rapid HIV testing site in Montreal, the pilot project Actuel sur Rue. Comparative analyses were conducted with 1357 MSM, 147 heterosexual men and 64 women who visited Actuel sur Rue between July 2012 and November 2013 on socio-demographics, health, drug use, sexual practices/infection and HIV testing/prevention. Significant group differences were observed in each category. Actuel sur Rue received 1901 clients, conducted 1417 rapid HIV tests and tested 77 never-tested individuals. Rapid testing produced a high reactive rate (2%). Only 1/28 of those with reactive tests had no previous HIV testing, and 36% had used post-exposure prophylaxis, suggesting missed opportunities for prevention. Findings highlight diverse client vulnerability profiles and the relevance of checkpoints and further prevention efforts.\t\t\n",
      "(0.716)  To determine effectiveness of alternate venue testing (AVT), social network strategy (SNS) and provider referral (PR) for identifying previously undiagnosed HIV-infected 18-64-year-old African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) by a health department. For AVT, staff used a mobile clinic to conduct HIV testing. For PR, staff solicited contact information from HIV-infected AA MSM, located contacts and offered HIV testing. For SNS, HIV-positive AA MSM recruited network associates for HIV testing. Two hundred and eighteen self-identified AA MSM were tested through AVT (25.2% HIV positivity) of whom 20 were newly identified HIV-positive. Fourteen HIV-positive men participated in SNS; 22 AA MSM contacts were recruited through SNS, eight (36.4%) were HIV positive and none were new positives. Two HIV-infected men participated in the PR strategy, yielding two AA MSM sex partners (one previously positive). The results suggest the need for health departments to consider using several complimentary strategies for identifying previously undiagnosed HIV infections in AA MSM in urban environments such as Baltimore. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\t\t\n",
      "(0.703)  HIV is generally sexually acquired across the genital or rectal mucosa after exposure to the genital secretions of an HIV-infected partner. Most exposures to HIV do not result in infection, likely due to protection afforded by an intact mucosal epithelium, as well as by innate and adaptive mucosal immune factors present in the genital tract. Another important mucosal determinant of transmission may be the number and activation status of potential HIV target cells, including CCR5/CD4+ T cells and DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells. The simultaneous presence of other genital infections, including classical sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can enhance HIV susceptibility either by breaching the epithelial barrier, recruiting HIV target cells to the genital tract, or by generating a pro-inflammatory local immune milieu. In HIV-infected individuals, genital co-infections increase HIV levels in the genital secretions, thereby increasing secondary sexual transmission. Co-infections that act as important HIV cofactors include human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and many others. Strategies focused on genital co-infections, such as vaccines, microbicides and suppressive therapy, are feasible in the short term and have the potential to curb the pandemic. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      "(0.677)  Public health messages shape how the world understands the HIV epidemic. Considerable inequalities remain in HIV care continuum indicators by subpopulation and geography (eg, highest infection and mortality burden among men who have sex with men and people who live in sub-Saharan Africa). Health equity-focused approaches are necessary in this next decade to close gaps in the HIV epidemic. Between 1981 and 1989, HIV messages triggered fear and victim blaming, and highlighted behaviours of a few marginalised groups as deviant. Between 1990 and 1999, messages signalled that HIV was a growing challenge for the world and required multisector approaches that addressed structural drivers of inequality. Between 2000 and 2009, messages highlighted universal testing, while advances in HIV testing made these messages easier for individuals to respond to than in previous decades. Currently, messages signal that ending HIV is possible, people can live productive lives with HIV, and transmission to people without HIV can be eliminated. Public health messaging about the HIV epidemic has evolved substantially over the past 40 years. Future HIV messaging should be driven by health equity principles that include an increased representation of key populations in message design and dissemination, transparency of funding, and communicating any impact that campaigns have had on closing health inequalities. \n",

      "(0.809)  Although the terms \"health equity\" and \"health disparities\" have become increasingly familiar to health professionals in the United States over the past two decades, they are rarely defined. Federal agencies have often defined \"health disparities\" in ways that encompass all health differences between any groups. Lack of clarity about the concepts of health disparities and health equity can have serious consequences for how resources are allocated, by removing social justice as an explicit consideration from policy agendas. This paper aims to make explicit what these concepts mean and to discuss what a life-course perspective can contribute to efforts to achieve health equity and eliminate health disparities. Equity means justice. Health equity is the principle or goal that motivates efforts to eliminate disparities in health between groups of people who are economically or socially worse-off and their better-off counterparts - such as different racial/ethnic or socioeconomic groups or groups defined by disability status, sexual orientation, or gender identity - by making special efforts to improve the health of those who are economically or socially disadvantaged. Health disparities are the metric by which we measure progress toward health equity. The basis for these definitions in ethical and human rights principles is discussed, along with the relevance of a life-course perspective for moving toward greater health equity © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\t\t\n",
      "(0.793)  Those concerned with poverty and health have sometimes viewed equity and human rights as abstract concepts with little practical application, and links between health, equity and human rights have not been examined systematically. Examination of the concepts of poverty, equity, and human rights in relation to health and to each other demonstrates that they are closely linked conceptually and operationally and that each provides valuable, unique guidance for health institutions' work. Equity and human rights perspectives can contribute concretely to health institutions' efforts to tackle poverty and health, and focusing on poverty is essential to operationalizing those commitments. Both equity and human rights principles dictate the necessity to strive for equal opportunity for health for groups of people who leave suffered marginalization or discrimination. Health institutions can deal with poverty and health within a framework encompassing equity and human rights concerns in five general ways: (1) institutionalizing the sytematic and ruotine application of equity and human rights perspectives to all health sector actions; (2) strengthening and extending the public health functions, other than health care, that create the conditions necessary for health; (3) implementing equitable health care financing, which should help reduce poverty while increasing access for the poor; (4) ensuring that health services respond effectively to the major causes of preventable ill-health among the poor and disadvantaged; and (5) monotoring, advocating and taking action to address the potential health equity and human rights implications of policies in all sectors affecting health, not only the health sector.\t\t\n",

After 1971, universal health insurance plans relying on the private sector complicated efforts of the universal health insurance movement. To forge as broad a movement for universal health insurance as possible, it may be worthwhile for universal health insurance advocates of different persuasions to seek common ground on the basis of a set of goals for a new health care system. The goals can serve as a measuring stick to determine which health insurance plans are worthy of support.\t\t\n",

Realizing this vision requires imagining a public health community that can maintain its foundational core while adapting and responding to contemporary imperatives such as entrenched inequities and ecological degradation. In this commentary, we reflect on what tomorrows public health might look like, from the point of view of our collective experiences as researchers in Canada who are part of an Applied Public Health Chairs program designed to support innovative population health research that improves health equity for citizens in Canada and around the world. We view applied public health research as sitting at the intersection of core principles for population and public health: namely sustainability, equity, and effectiveness. We further identify three attributes of a robust applied public health research community that we argue are necessary to permit contribution to those principles: researcher autonomy, sustained intersectoral research capacity, and a critical perspective on the research-practice-policy interface. Our intention is to catalyze further discussion and debate about why and how public health matters today and tomorrow, and the role of applied public health research therein.\t\t\n",
      "(0.695)  Public health is complex and previous work has demonstrated the value of systems modelling in understanding its complexity. Today the need for systems modelling in public health has increased because the delivery of the public health function is being reengineered with an additional layer of complexity. The service is now more distributed and as a consequence there is a demand that information and communication technologies (ICT) should be employed to a greater extent in ensuring public health provision. It is essential that a good public health service is maintained within this new framework and the public health network (PHN) has been proposed as the solution. We aim to demonstrate the potential value of systems modelling in this newly re-engineered public health environment by showing how it can be used to convert the complex input of the public health network project into a realistic, holistic and potentially successful plan to implement and evaluate the network.

      "(0.72)  The 2014/15 influenza season in the United Kingdom (UK) was characterised by circulation of predominantly antigenically and genetically drifted influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses. A universal paediatric influenza vaccination programme using a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has recently been introduced in the UK. This study aims to measure the end-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), including for LAIV, using the test negative casecontrol design. The overall adjusted VE against all influenza was 34.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.8 to 47.5); for A(H3N2) 29.3% (95% CI: 8.6 to 45.3) and for B 46.3% (95% CI: 13.9 to 66.5). For those aged under 18 years, influenza A(H3N2) LAIV VE was 35% (95% CI: -29.9 to 67.5), whereas for influenza B the LAIV VE was 100% (95% CI:17.0 to 100.0). Although the VE against influenza A(H3N2) infection was low, there was still evidence of significant protection, together with moderate, significant protection against drifted circulating influenza B viruses. LAIV provided non-significant positive protection against influenza A, with significant protection against B. Further work to assess the population impact of the vaccine programme across the UK is underway.\t\t\n",
      "(0.668)  Background: Given the variation in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage across Canada, and debate regarding delivery of HPV vaccines in Catholic schools, we studied online comments on Canadian news websites to understand public perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccine. Methods: We searched English- and French-language Canadian news websites for 2012 articles that contained the terms \"HPV\" or \"human papillomavirus.\" Articles about HPV vaccinations that contained at least one comment were included. Two researchers independently coded comments, analyzing them for emerging themes. Results: We identified 3073 comments from 1198 individuals in response to 71 news articles; 630 (52.6%) individuals expressed positive sentiments about HPV vaccination (2.5 comments/individual), 404 (33.7%) were negative (3.0 comments/individual), 34 (2.8%) were mixed (1.5 comments/individual) and 130 (10.8%) were neutral (1.6 comments/individual). Vaccine-supportive commenters believed the vaccine is safe and effective. Common themes in negative comments included concerns regarding HPV vaccine safety and efficacy, distrust of pharmaceutical companies and government, and belief that school-age children are too young for HPV vaccine. Many comments focused on whether the Catholic Church has the right to inform health policy for students, and discussion often evolved into debates regarding HPV and sexual behaviour. We noted that many individuals doubted the credibility of vaccine safety information. Conclusion: The majority of commenters do not appear to be against HPV vaccination, but public health messaging that focuses on both the vaccine's safety profile, and its use as a means to prevent cancer rather than sexually transmitted HPV infection may facilitate its acceptance.\t\t\n",
      "(0.668)  The United Kingdom (UK) is in the third season of introducing universal paediatric influenza vaccination with a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). The 2015/16 season in the UK was initially dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and then influenza of B/Victoria lineage, not contained in that seasons adult trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Overall adjusted end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 52.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 41.0-61.6) against influenza-confirmed primary care consultation, 54.5% (95% CI: 41.6-64.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 54.2% (95% CI: 33.1-68.6) against influenza B. In 2-17 year-olds, adjusted VE for LAIV was 57.6% (95% CI: 25.1 to 76.0) against any influenza, 81.4% (95% CI: 39.6-94.3) against influenza B and 41.5% (95% CI: -8.5 to 68.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These estimates demonstrate moderate to good levels of protection, particularly against influenza B in children, but relatively less against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Despite lineage mismatch in the trivalent IIV, adults younger than 65 years were still protected against influenza B. These results provide reassurance for the UK to continue its influenza immunisation programme planned for 2016/17.\t\t\n",
      "(0.61)  Background: To compare cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on Markov modelling over 5 years, from a Hong Kong public health provider's perspective, on a hypothetical cohort of LTCF residents aged =65 years. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and net present value (NPV) of two vaccination strategies versus no vaccination were estimated. The cost and QALYs gained by two vaccination strategies were compared by Student's t-test in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10 000 Monte Carlo simulations). Results: Both vaccination strategies had high BCRs and NPVs (6.39 and US$334 for influenza vaccination; 5.10 and US$332 for influenza plus pneumococcal vaccination). In base case analysis, the two vaccination strategies were expected to cost less and gain higher QALYs than no vaccination. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost of combined vaccination and influenza vaccination was significantly lower (p<0.001) than the cost of no vaccination. Both vaccination strategies gained significantly higher (p<0.001) QALYs than no vaccination. The QALYs gained by combined vaccination were significantly higher (p=0.030) than those gained by influenza vaccination alone. The total cost of combined vaccination was significantly lower (p=0.011) than that of influenza vaccination. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination appears to be less costly with higher QALYs gained than no vaccination, over a 5-year period, for elderly people living in LTCFs from the perspective of a Hong Kong public health organisation. Combined vaccination was more likely to gain higher QALYs with lower total cost than influenza vaccination alone.\t\t\n",
      "(0.603)  Background: Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion regarding the benefits of receiving the current season's vaccine. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: current season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (dVE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241). Results: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (dVE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (dVE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (dVE = 7%; 95% CI - 7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the current season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (dVE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (dVE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (dVE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the current season only for H1N1 (dVE = 3%; 95% CI - 8%, 13%), but less protection against influenza H3N2 (dVE = - 20%; 95% CI - 36%, - 4%), and B (dVE = - 11%; 95% CI - 20%, - 2%). Conclusions: Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes, and for H1N1 and influenza B, vaccination in both seasons provides better VE than vaccination in the prior season only. Although VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only, it should be noted that past vaccination history cannot be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only. In addition, our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014-2015 influenza season and the impact of repeated vaccination for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season. It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail. \n",

We reviewed rates of MRSA in two hospitals in Vancouver, Canada, to observe changes in epidemiology from 2003 to 2011. Episodes of emergency department (ED) MRSA bacteraemia and wounds were extracted from the laboratory database, with rates calculated per 10000 ED visits. All cases were assumed to be community onset, as they were diagnosed in the ED. A peak in ED MRSA bacteraemias occurred in 2005, at 7·8/10000 ED visits. By 2011, rates of ED bacteraemia declined significantly to 3·3/10000 ED visits (P=0·03). MRSA wound rates peaked at 82·2 cases/10000 ED visits in 2007 with a subsequent significant decline to 34·3 cases in 2011 (P=0·04). We have demonstrated a significant decline in CO-MRSA within our population, consistent with reports from the USA, suggesting a sbstantial change in the epidemiology of CO-MRSA in certain North American cities. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.\t\t\n",
      "(0.668)  Objectives: To compare breastfeeding rates at discharge for very preterm infants between European regions and neonatal units, and to identify characteristics associated with breast feeding using multilevel models. Methods: Population-based cohort of 3006 very preterm births (22-31 weeks of gestation) discharged home from neonatal units in eight European regions in 2003. Results: Breastfeeding rates varied from 19% in Burgundy to 70% in Lazio, and were correlated with national rates in the entire newborn population. Women were more likely to breast feed if they were older, primiparous and European; more premature, smaller and multiple babies or those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were breast fed less. Variations across regions and neonatal units remained statistically significant after adjusting for maternal, infant and unit characteristics. Conclusion: It is possible to achieve high breastfeeding rates for very preterm infants, but rates varied widely across regions and neonatal units throughout Europe.\t\t\n",

Summary of Background Data. The rates of spine surgery in the United States have increased along with a concurrent rise in the use of advanced spinal imaging: CT and MRI. Spine surgery rates vary six-fold across geographic areas of the United States. Differences in patient populations and health care supply have explained only about 10% of this variation. Methods. We used a random 5% sample of Medicare's National Claims History Part B files for 1996 and 1997 to determine procedure rates across 306 Hospital Referral Regions. We analyzed the association between spinal imaging and spine surgery using linear regression. Main outcome measures were rates of procedures and coefficients of determination (R2). Results. The rates of advanced spinal imaging (CT and MRI combined) varied 5.5-fold across geographic areas. Areas with higher rates of MRI had higher rates of spine surgery overall (r = 0.46) and spinal stenosis surgery specifically (r = 0.37). The rates of advanced spinal imaging accounted for 22% of the variability in overall spine surgery rates (R2 = 0.22, P < 0.001) and 14% of the variability in lumbar stenosis surgery rates (R2 = 0.14, P < 0.001). A simulation model showed that MRIs obtained in the patients undergoing surgery accounted for only a small part of the correlation between MRI and total spine surgery rates. Conclusions. A significant proportion of the variation in rates of spine surgery can be explained by differences in the rates of advanced spinal imaging. The indications for advanced spinal imaging are not firmly agreed on, and the appropriateness of many of these imaging studies has been questioned. Improved consensus on the use and interpretation of advanced spinal imaging studies could have an important effect on variation in spine surgery rates.\t\t\n",

To describe recent trends and geographic variation in population-based rates of lumbar fusion spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Lumbar fusion rates have increased dramatically during the 1980s and even more so in the 1990s. The most rapid increase appeared to follow the approval of a new surgical implant device. METHODS. Medicare claims and enrollment data were used to calculate age, sex, and race-adjusted rates of lumbar laminectomy/discectomy and lumbar fusion for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 in each of the 306 US Hospital Referral Regions between 1992 and 2003. RESULTS. Lumbar fusion rates have increased steadily since 1992 (0.3 per 1000 enrollees in 1992 to 1.1 per 1000 enrollees in 2003). Regional rates of lumbar discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion in 1992-1993 were highly correlated to rates of discectomy, laminectomy (R = 0.44), and fusion (R = 0.28) in 2002-2003. There was a nearly 8-fold variation in regional rates of lumbar discectomy and laminectomy in 2002 and 2003. In the case of lumbar fusion, there was nearly a 20-fold range in rates among Medicare enrollees in 2002 and 2003. This represents the largest coefficient of variation seen with any surgical procedure. Medicare spending for inpatient back surgery more than doubled over the decade. Spending for lumbar fusion increased more than 500%, from $75 million to $482 million. In 1992, lumbar fusion represented 14% of total spending for back surgery; by 2003, lumbar fusion accounted for 47% of spending. CONCLUSIONS. The rate of specific procedures within a region or \"surgical signature\" is remarkably stable over time. However, there has been a marked increase in rates of fusion, and a coincident shift and increase in cost. Rates of back surgery were not correlated with the per-capita supply of orthopedic and neurosurgeons. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.59)  Introduction Suicide rates and the proportion of alcohol-involved suicides rose during the 20082009 recession. Associations between county-level poverty, foreclosures, and unemployment and suicide rates and proportion of alcohol-involved suicides were investigated. Methods In 2015, National Violent Death Reporting System data from 16 states in 20052011 were utilized to calculate suicide rates and a measure of alcohol involvement in suicides at the county level. Panel models with year and state fixed effects included county-level measures of unemployment, foreclosure, and poverty rates. Results Poverty rates were strongly associated with suicide rates for both genders and all age groups, were positively associated with alcohol involvement in suicides for men aged 4564 years, and negatively associated for men aged 2044 years. Foreclosure rates were negatively associated with suicide rates for women and those aged =65 years but positively related for those aged 4564 years. Unemployment rate effects on suicide rates were mediated by poverty rates in all groups. Conclusions Population risk of suicide was most clearly associated with county-level poverty rates, indicating that programs addressing area poverty should be targeted for reducing suicide risk. Poverty rates were also associated with increased alcohol involvement for men aged 4564 years, indicating a role for alcohol in suicide for this working-aged group. However, negative associations between economic indicators and alcohol involvement were found for four groups, suggesting that non-economic factors or more general economic effects not captured by these indicators may have played a larger role in alcohol-related suicide increases. \n",

      "(0.446)  The TABLE summarizes the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with regard to adolescent screening. We identified no additional evidence-based recommendations for screening tests for adolescents. As shown in the TABLE, rubella susceptibility screening is recommended for all adolescent females (SOR: B). Sexually active adolescent females should routinely be screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and cervical cancer. Adolescents at risk of contracting TB, HIV, or syphilis should be screened for those diseases. Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against performing the following tests for adolescents: hearing loss screening, anemia screening, clinical or self breast examination, blood pressure screening, screening for overweight, screening for alcohol misuse, screening for depression, and suicide risk screening. For males, evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against: rubella screening, routine rubella vaccination, and chlamydia or gonorrhea screening for sexually active males. Do not perform the following tests on adolescents because evidence is good that the harms outweigh the benefits: testicular cancer screening using clinical or self-testicular examination, hepatitis B screening, screening for herpes, thyroid cancer screening, screening for scoliosis, and bacteriuria screening in asymptomatic non-pregnant adolescents. Screening for lipid disorders is recommended only for those over age 20 years who have significant risks for coronary artery disease.\t\t\n",
      "(0.423)  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is increasing worldwide. A high proportion of individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but RCC has a high mortality rate. These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.\t\t\n",
      "(0.423)  Given current policy that decisions about screening should be based on informed choice, such decisions should reflect people's values and attitudes. This prospective study compares the attitudes and other cognitive predictors of screening uptake in two contexts: when conducted as part of a routine visit and when it is conducted at a separate, test-specific visit. It was conducted in two hospitals in England, differing in method of screening organisation. 1499 pregnant women offered serum screening for Down Syndrome completed a questionnaire assessing theory of planned behaviour constructs: attitude towards undergoing the test, subjective norms of others, perceived behavioural control and intention to undergo the test. Intention predicted screening uptake in both screening settings, but more strongly when screening was part of a routine visit. Perceived behavioural control was not predictive of uptake, and only weakly predictive of intention in both settings. Subjective norm predicted intention more strongly when it referred to partner and friends than when it referred to health professionals, in both settings. Attitude was more strongly predictive of intention to attend screening when screening was organised as a part of routine screening, rather than requiring a separate visit. These results suggest that offering a screening test at a routine visit compared with a separate visit is more likely to facilitated uninformed choices, given the stronger association between attitudes and intention and the absence of an association with the perceived influence of health professionals.\t\t\n",
      "(0.416)  Background: To determine the impact of a co-payment on the cost-effectiveness of systematic screening for diabetic retinopathy in Hong Kong (HK). Methods: An analysis was conducted from provider and societal perspectives. A Markov cohort model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening with a co-payment of HK$60 (US$7.7) compared with free screening, with and without an assumption that the inverse care law (ICL) would operate in the presence of a fee as seen in our previous data. Results: From the provider perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of free versus pay systematic screening was HK$166 558 (US$21 354)/extra quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained assuming an effect of the ICL and free screening was always more cost-effective than pay screening when willingness to pay for a QALY was HK$124 488 (US$15 960) or above. Without an effect of the ICL, the ICER was HK$480 479 (US$61 600)/extra QALY gained. From the societal perspective, the ICER was HK$144 046 (US$18 467)/extra QALY gained with an effect of the ICL and HK$199 741 (US$25 608)/extra QALY gained with no effect. Conclusions: Free systematic screening was highly cost-effective from the societal perspective compared with screening with a small co-payment irrespective of the effects of the ICL. From the provider perspective, free screening was highly cost-effective if the ICL operates.\t\t\n",
      "(0.415)  Background: U.S. professional organizations increasingly agree that most women require Papanicolaou smear screening every 2 to 3 years rather than annually and that most elderly women may stop screening. We sought to describe the attitudes of women in the United States toward less intense screening, specifically, less frequent screening and eventual cessation of screening. Methods: We conducted a random-digit-dialing telephone survey of women in 2002 (response rate of 75% among eligible women reached by telephone). A nationally representative sample of 360 women aged 40 years or older with no history of cancer was surveyed about their acceptance of less intense screening. Results: Almost all women aged 40 years or older (99%) had had at least one Pap smear; most (59%) were screened annually. When women were asked to choose their preferred frequency for screening, 75% preferred screening at least annually (12% chose screening every 6 months). Less than half (43%) had heard of recommendations advocating less frequent screening. When advised of such recommendations, half of all women believed that they were based on cost. Sixty-nine percent said that they would try to continue being screened annually even if their doctors recommended less frequent screening and advised them of comparable benefits. Only 35% of women thought that there might come a time when they would stop getting Pap smears; of these, almost half would not stop until after age 80 years. The strongest predictor of reluctance to reduce the frequency of screening was a belief that cost was the basis of current screening frequency recommendations. Conclusion: Most women in the United States prefer annual Pap smears and are resistant to the idea of less intense screening. Concern that cost considerations rather than evidence form the basis of screening recommendations may partly explain women's reluctance to accept less intense screening. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

      "(0.693)  Objective: To evaluate the prognostic utility of the presence, persistence, and patterns of depression in subjects with anmestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Method: Sixty amnestic MCI patients were assessed cognitively and for presence of depression using the 30 item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). They were followed annually for an average period of 4.3 years. Results: Simple presence or absence of depression at referral did not predict progression of MCI to AD. Positive answers to specific GDS questions referring to \"melancholic\" affect as well as the persistence of depression over two to three years significantly predicted cognitive deterioration leading to AD. Conclusion: The affective characteristics of depression at referral and the persistence of depression were better predictors of conversion to AD than the simple presence or absence of depression measured at referral time.

      "(0.613)  Recently, Scambler and others have broadened the research agenda on stigma to include the wider meanings of stigma within society, and especially the role of identity politics e.g. gay liberation. Recognising that the categories 'homosexual' and 'depression' were socially constructed and stigmatised from the 19 th and 20 th centuries respectively, we draw on themes in conceptual models of coming out as gay or lesbian to sensitise our analysis to personal experiences of depression and the specific ways in which the condition is constructed. Thirty-eight narrative interviews with people in the UK in various stages of recovery from depression were analysed comparing themes to a 'coming out' framework. The applicability of coming out themes to understanding the construction of depression was evident. Themes included childhood difference; confusion; the depression closet; challenging stigma via the biology vs. nurture debate; re-casting depression as commonplace or even fashionable; contending with a shame-pride narrative; coming out and, finally, integrating the depression experience. By comparing 'coming out' themes with depression experience in detail for the first time, we illuminate how people understand depression, cope with and resist stigma, thus providing insights into the contemporary situation in Western societies for those facing depression. © 2011 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\t\t\n",
      "(0.576)  Objective Depression is a potential risk factor for developing IBD. This association may be related to GI symptoms occurring before diagnosis. We aimed to determine whether depression, adjusted for pre-existing GI symptoms, is associated with subsequent IBD. Design We conducted a nested case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink identifying incident cases of UC and Crohn's disease (CD) from 1998 to 2016. Controls without IBD were matched for age and sex. We measured exposure to prevalent depression 4.5-5.5 years before IBD diagnosis. We created two sub-groups with prevalent depression based on whether individuals had reported GI symptoms before the onset of depression. We used conditional logistic regression to derive ORs for the risk of IBD depending on depression status. Results We identified 10 829 UC cases, 4531 CD cases and 15 360 controls. There was an excess of prevalent depression 5 years before IBD diagnosis relative to controls (UC: 3.7% vs 2.7%, CD 3.7% vs 2.9%). Individuals with GI symptoms prior to the diagnosis of depression had increased adjusted risks of developing UC and CD compared with those without depression (UC: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.79; CD: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.92). Individuals with depression alone had similar risks of UC and CD to those without depression (UC: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; CD: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.38). Conclusions Depression, in the absence of prior GI symptoms, is not associated with subsequent development of IBD. However, depression with GI symptoms should prompt investigation for IBD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.538)  During the last two decades, postnatal depression has become a widely accepted and very popular psychiatric diagnosis, in both scientific and lay writings. Despite its popularity, the postnatal depression diagnosis has raised many questions and controversies, particularly around the specific character of depression during the postpartum period. In order to shed light to this paradox, we first examine the arguments used to justify the distinctive character of the postnatal depression diagnostic category. Second, we explore some driving forces that may have contributed to the legitimacy of this diagnosis: professional factors and general public discourses. Regardless of assumptions taken for granted about the specificity of the postnatal depression diagnosis, there is no consensus about its definition. Furthermore, its symptoms and contributing risk factors do not seem to differ from those present in major depression episodes suffered at any other lifespan period. In such a context, the high legitimacy of this diagnostic category might be linked to the development of specific tools conceived for measuring postnatal depression, the progressive medicalisation of different spheres of social life in general, and women lives in particular; and contemporary changes in the institution of motherhood. © Common Ground, Catherine des Rivières-Pigeon, Charo Rodríguez, Gabrielle Nicole All Rights Reserved.\t\t\n",
      "(0.523)  This research aims to identify distinct courses of depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older Americans and to ascertain how these courses vary by race/ethnicity. Data came from the 1995-2006 Health and Retirement Study which involved a national sample of 17,196 Americans over 50 years of age with up to six repeated observations. Depressive symptoms were measured by an abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Semiparametric group based mixture models (Proc Traj) were used for data analysis. Six major trajectories were identified: (a) minimal depressive symptoms (15.9%), (b) low depressive symptoms (36.3%), (c) moderate and stable depressive symptoms (29.2%), (d) high but decreasing depressive symptoms (6.6%), (e) moderate but increasing depressive symptoms (8.3%), and (f) persistently high depressive symptoms (3.6%). Adjustment of time-varying covariates (e.g., income and health conditions) resulted in a similar set of distinct trajectories. Relative to White Americans, Black and Hispanic Americans were significantly more likely to be in trajectories of more elevated depressive symptoms. In addition, they were more likely to experience increasing and decreasing depressive symptoms. Racial and ethnic variations in trajectory groups were partially mediated by SES, marital status, and health conditions, particularly when both interpersonal and intrapersonal differences in these variables were taken into account. © 2011 American Psychological Association. \n",

      "(0.626)  Despite growing numbers of American Muslims, little empirical work exists on their use of traditional healing practices. We explored the types of traditional healing practices used by American Muslims in southeast Michigan. Twelve semi-structured interviews with American Muslim community leaders identified through a community-academic steering committee were conducted. Using a framework coding structure, a multidisciplinary investigative team identified themes describing traditional healing practices. Traditional healing practices can be categorized into three domains: Islamic religious text based practices, Islamic worship practices, and folk healing practices. Each domain may further contain therapies such as spiritual healing, medicinal herbs, mind body therapy, and dietary prescriptions. Traditional healing practices are utilized in three capacities of care: primary, secondary, and integrative. Our findings demonstrate that AmericanMuslims actively utilize traditional healing practices.

      "(0.509)  Background: Limited data exist to estimate the use of electronic health records (EHRs) in ambulatory care practices in the United States. Methods: We surveyed a stratified random sample of 1829 office practices in Massachusetts in 2005. The one-page survey measured use of health information technology, plans for EHR adoption and perceived barriers to adoption. Results: A total of 847 surveys were returned, for a response rate of 46%. Overall, 18% of office practices reported having an EHR. Primary-care-only and mixed practices reported similar adoption rates (23% and 25%, respectively, P = 0.70). The adoption rate in specialty practices (14%) was lower compared with both primary-care-only (P < 0.01) and mixed (P < 0.05) practices. The number of clinicians in the practice strongly correlated with EHR adoption (P < 0.001), with fewer small practices adopting EHRs. Among practices that have EHRs with laboratory and radiology result retrieval capabilities, at least 87% of practices report that a majority of their clinicians actively use these functionalities, while 74% of practices with electronic decision support report that the majority of clinicians actively use it. Among the practices without an EHR, 13% plan to implement one within the next 12 months, 24% within the next 1-2 years, 11% within the next 3-5 years, and 52% reported having no plans to implement an EHR in the foreseeable future. The most frequently reported barrier to implementation was lack of adequate funding (42%). Conclusions: Overall, fewer than 1 in 5 medical practices in Massachusetts have an EHR. Even among adopters, though, doctor usage of EHR functions varied considerably by functionality and across practices. Many clinicians are not actively using functionalities that are necessary to improve health care quality and patient safety. Furthermore, among practices that do not have EHRs, more than half have no plan for adoption. Inadequate funding remains an important barrier to EHR adoption in ambulatory care practices in the United States. © 2008 The Authors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.468)  Objective. To describe physician practices, ranging from solo and two-physician practices to large medical groups, in three geographically diverse parts of the country with strong managed care presences. Data Sources/Study Design. Surveys of medical practices in three managed care markets conducted in 2000-2001. Study Design. We administered questionnaires to all medical practices affiliated with two large health plans in Boston, MA, and Portland, OR, and to all practices providing primary care for cardiovascular disease patients admitted to five large hospitals in Minneapolis, MN. We offer data on how physician practices are structured under managed care in these geographically diverse regions of the country with a focus on the structural characteristics, financial arrangements, and care management strategies adopted by practices. Data Collection. A two-staged survey consisting of an initial telephone survey that was undertaken using CATI (computerized assisted telephone interviewing) techniques followed by written modules triggered by specific responses to the telephone survey. Principal Findings. We interviewed 468 practices encompassing 668 distinct sites of care (overall response rate 72 percent). Practices had an average of 13.9 member physicians (range: 1-125). Most (80.1 percent) medium- (four to nine physicians) and large-size (10 or more physicians) groups regularly scheduled meetings to discuss resource utilization and referrals. Almost 90 percent of the practices reported that these meetings occurred at least once per month. The predominant method for paying practices was via fee-for-service payments. Most other payments were in the form of capitation. Overall, 75 percent of physician practices compensated physicians based on productivity, but there was substantial variation related to practice size. Nonetheless, of the practices that did not use straight productivity methods (45 percent of medium-sized practices and 54 percent of large practices), most used arrangements consisting of combinations of salary and productivity formulas. Conclusions. We found diversity in the characteristics and capabilities of medical practices in these three markets with high managed care involvement. Financial practices of most practices are geared towards rewarding productivity, and care management practices and capabilities such as electronic medical records remain underdeveloped.\t\t\n",
      "(0.437)  Objectives Approximately one in eight practices in primary care in England are 'dispensing practices' with an in-house dispensary providing medication directly to patients. These practices can generate additional income by negotiating lower prices on higher cost drugs, while being reimbursed at a standard rate. They, therefore, have a potential financial conflict of interest around prescribing choices. We aimed to determine whether dispensing practices are more likely to prescribe high-cost options for four commonly prescribed classes of drug where there is no evidence of superiority for high-cost options. Design A list was generated of drugs with high acquisition costs that were no more clinically effective than those with the lowest acquisition costs, for all four classes of drug examined. Data were obtained prescribing of statins, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEis). Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs for prescribing high-cost options in dispensing practices, adjusting for Index of Multiple Deprivation score, practice list size and the number of doctors at each practice. Setting English primary care. Participants All general practices in England. Main outcome measures Mean cost per dose was calculated separately for dispensing and non-dispensing practices. Dispensing practices can vary in the number of patients they dispense to; we, therefore, additionally compared practices with no dispensing patients, low, medium and high proportions of dispensing patients. Total cost savings were modelled by applying the mean cost per dose from non-dispensing practices to the number of doses prescribed in dispensing practices. Results Dispensing practices were more likely to prescribe high-cost drugs across all classes: statins adjusted OR 1.51 (95% CI 1.49 to 1.53, p<0.0001), PPIs OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.13, p<0.0001), ACEi OR 2.58 (95% CI 2.46 to 2.70, p<0.0001), ARB OR 5.11 (95% CI 5.02 to 5.20, p<0.0001). Mean cost per dose in pence was higher in dispensing practices (statins 7.44 vs 6.27, PPIs 5.57 vs 5.46, ACEi 4.30 vs 4.24, ARB 11.09 vs 8.19). For all drug classes, the more dispensing patients a practice had, the more likely it was to issue a prescription for a high-cost option. Total cost savings in England available from all four classes are £628 875 per month or £7 546 502 per year. Conclusions Doctors in dispensing practices are more likely to prescribe higher cost drugs. This is the largest study ever conducted on dispensing practices, and the first contemporary research suggesting some UK doctors respond to a financial conflict of interest in treatment decisions. The reimbursement system for dispensing practices may generate unintended consequences. Robust routine audit of practices prescribing higher volumes of unnecessarily expensive drugs may help reduce costs.\t\t\n",

      "(0.618)  The group-based latent trajectory model allows investigators to identify distinctive trajectory groups based on relevant outcomes. Dual trajectory analysis enables examination of the interrelationship between two outcomes simultaneously. This paper describes the application of the group-based dual trajectory model in mental health and substance abuse research. We analyzed two related recovery outcomes: 1) social contact with non-substance abusing friends and 2) stage of substance abuse treatment. We identified four groups for social contact and four groups for substance abuse treatment. We then examined the interrelationship between the two outcomes across the trajectory groups over 10 years. The two outcomes are positively associated longitudinally and evolve in the same direction, although for specific groups, the two outcomes do not covary. By examining dynamic linkages across all trajectory groups between two longitudinal outcomes, the dual model provides a more comprehensive and realistic understanding of the underlying relationships between the two outcomes under investigation. © 2009 by the Journal of Drug Issues.\t\t\n",
      "(0.618)  There is uncertainty about whether hypoxic injury accompanying donor death from ligature asphyxiation influences renal transplant outcomes, particularly for recipients of kidneys donated after circulatory death (DCD). The UK Registry analysis was undertaken to determine transplant outcomes in recipients of kidneys from donors who died following ligature asphyxiation. From 2003 to 2016, 2.7% (n = 521) of potential organ donors died following ligature asphyxiation (mostly suicide by hanging). Of these, 409 (78.5%) donated kidneys for transplantation (46.9% donation after brain death [DBD] and 53.1% DCD donors) resulting in 650 kidney transplants. Compared to other deceased donors, those dying from ligature asphyxiation were younger, more often male, and had less hypertension. Unadjusted patient and graft survival were superior for recipients of both DBD and DCD kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation, although after adjustment for donor/recipient variables, transplant outcomes were similar. A casecontrol matched analysis confirmed transplant outcomes for those who received kidneys from donors dying after ligature asphyxiation were similar to controls. Although caution is required in interpreting these findings because of potential selection bias, kidneys from donors dying of ligature asphyxiation suffer an additional warm ischemic insult that does not apparently adversely influence transplant outcomes, even for kidneys from DCD donors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.615)  Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) contributes to poor birth outcomes, in part through disrupted placental functions, which may be reflected in the placental epigenome. Here we present a meta-analysis of the associations between MSDP and placental DNA methylation (DNAm) and between DNAm and birth outcomes within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium (N = 1700, 344 with MSDP). We identify 443 CpGs that are associated with MSDP, of which 142 associated with birth outcomes, 40 associated with gene expression, and 13 CpGs are associated with all three. Only two CpGs have consistent associations from a prior meta-analysis of cord blood DNAm, demonstrating substantial tissue-specific responses to MSDP. The placental MSDP-associated CpGs are enriched for environmental response genes, growth-factor signaling, and inflammation, which play important roles in placental function. We demonstrate links between placental DNAm, MSDP and poor birth outcomes, which may better inform the mechanisms through which MSDP impacts placental function and fetal growth.\t\t\n",
      "(0.603)  High magnitudes and rates of loading have been implicated in the etiology of running-related injuries. Knowledge of kinematic variables that are predictive of kinetic outcomes could inform clinic-based gait retraining programs. Healthy novice female runners ran on a treadmill while 3-dimensional biomechanical data were collected. Kinetic outcomes consisted of vertical impact transient, average vertical loading rate, instantaneous vertical loading rate, and peak braking force. Kinematic outcomes included step length), hip flexion angle at initial contact, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass at initial contact, shank angle at initial contact, and foot strike angle. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the amount of variance in kinetic outcomes explained by kinematic outcomes. A moderate amount of variance in kinetic outcomes (vertical impact transient = 46%, average vertical loading rate = 37%, instantaneous vertical loading rate = 49%, peak braking force = 54%) was explained by several discrete kinematic variablespredominantly speed, horizontal distance from heel to center of mass, foot strike angle, and step length. Hip flexion angle and shank angle did not contribute to any models. Decreasing step length and transitioning from a rearfoot strike may reduce kinetic risk factors for running-related injuries. In contrast, clinical strategies such as modifying shank angle and hip flexion angle would not appear to contribute significantly to the variance of kinetic outcomes after accounting for other variables.\t\t\n",

Sample: A long list of potential core outcomes was developed by undertaking a systematic review of pre-eclampsia trials and performing a thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews. Methods: Specific methods used to generate long lists of potential core outcomes were evaluated. Results: Different methodological decisions had a substantial impact on the identification of potential core outcomes. Extracting outcomes from published pre-eclampsia trials was an effective way of identifying 48 maternal, eight fetal, 25 neonatal outcomes, and eight patient-reported outcomes. Limiting the extraction of outcomes to primary outcomes or outcomes commonly reported in pre-eclampsia trials reduced the number and diversity of potential core outcomes identified. Thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews ensured an additional five patient reported outcomes and six outcomes related to future child health were identified. Conclusions: Future core outcome set developers should use quantitative and qualitative methods when developing a long list of potential core outcomes.

      "(0.72)  Study Aim: Recent investigations have suggested that CPR training rates are low within the U.S and barriers to CPR training are poorly understood. Social media holds great potential for large scale capture of the public's CPR training experiences and may illuminate barriers to CPR training. While studies have examined Twitter data for behaviors associated with cardiovascular health, no investigation has evaluated Twitter data to understand public perception of CPR training. We characterized Tweet content about CPR training and associated sentiment to better understand barriers associated with CPR training. We hypothesized that negative CPR training impressions would be identifiable as barriers to CPR training attainment. Methods: We extracted Tweets from 2011 to 2015 originating in Pennsylvania including the keyword CPR (n = 8419). A random subset of 1000 tweets was independently coded by two authors using grounded theory (mean kappa = 0.74). CPR training Tweets were analyzed for subtopic and sentiment (positive or negative). Descriptive statistics were used; a chi squared test was used to examine differences in positive and negative responses. Results: Of 8419 Tweets, CPR training was the most frequent queried result (16%). Within the coded 1000 subset, 18% referenced a CPR training experience. Upcoming CPR training (22%), CPR training curriculum (17%), job-related training (12%), and duration of training (10%) were the most discussed topics regarding CPR training experiences. Of those, the majority of CPR training experiences were negative (53% vs. 47%, p < 0.01) and barriers to CPR training emerged as the primary source of negative experiences. Conclusions: CPR training is the most referenced theme in CPR Tweets from Pennsylvania, and tweets were predominately negative, particularly referencing barriers such as time, location, and duration. Social media is useful for tracking barriers to CPR training attainment and future CPR education modalities.\t\t\n",
      "(0.717)  Objective To understand general practice (GP) residents' attitudes about their residency training in China. Design Mixed methods survey administered cross-sectionally. Setting Two GP training programmes similar in most regards according to current GP training policy of 5 years' undergraduate degree in medicine and 3 years of postgraduate GP residency training - but differing as the Beijing programme has adopted educational innovations beyond the nationally prescribed standard curriculum used by the second Shenzhen programme. Participants 105 (85%) of eligible GP trainees, 35 (90%) in the innovative Beijing programme and 70 (83%) in the standard training Shenzhen programme. Results Overall, residents felt discrimination because of specialty choice, and that they lacked competency as a general practitioner. Many residents commented faculty had negative teaching attitudes. Beijing residents were more satisfied than Shenzhen residents with their training (p=0.001), and felt teaching faculty had sufficient knowledge (p<0.001), and appropriate attitudes towards teaching (p=0.004). Beijing residents more strongly agreed on five items about good future job prospects (all p<0.05). Conclusion These Chinese GP residents identify areas for improvement in their training as well as strengths. Higher satisfaction with faculty teaching and job optimism in Beijing where GP residents receive training from specifically qualified faculty, and can earn special certification, suggest that the educational innovations enhance training and promote positivity about job prospects. These findings imply that GP residents in China face many training challenges that are similar to other international reports, while also implicating benefits of using an innovative curricular approach.\t\t\n",
      "(0.714)  Humans and pigeons were trained to discriminate between 2 views of actual 3-D objects or their photographs. They were tested on novel views that were either within the closest rotational distance between the training views (interpolated) or outside of that range (extrapolated). When training views were 60° apart, pigeons, but not humans, recognized novel views of actual objects better than their pictures. Further, both species recognized interpolated views of both stimulus types better than extrapolated views, but a single distinctive geon enhanced recognition of novel views only for humans. When training views were 90° apart, pigeons recognized interpolated views better than extrapolated views with actual objects but not with photographs, Thus, pigeons may represent actual objects differently than their pictures. © 2005 by the American Psychological Association.\t\t\n",
      "(0.694)  Emerging research indicates that exercise combined with cognitive training may improve cognitive function in older adults. Typically these programs have incorporated sequential training, where exercise and cognitive training are undertaken separately. However, simultaneous or dual-task training, where cognitive and/or motor training are performed simultaneously with exercise, may offer greater benefits. This review summary provides an overview of the effects of combined simultaneous vs. sequential training on cognitive function in older adults. Based on the available evidence, there are inconsistent findings with regard to the cognitive benefits of sequential training in comparison to cognitive or exercise training alone. In contrast, simultaneous training interventions, particularly multimodal exercise programs in combination with secondary tasks regulated by sensory cues, have significantly improved cognition in both healthy older and clinical populations. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal characteristics of a successful simultaneous training program for optimizing cognitive function in older people.\t\t\n",
      "(0.649)  Many sports incorporate training at altitude as a key component of their athlete training plan. Furthermore, many sports are required to compete at high altitude venues. Exercise at high altitude provides unique challenges to the athlete and to the sport medicine clinician working with these athletes. These challenges include altitude illness, alterations in training intensity and performance, nutritional and hydration difficulties, and challenges related to the austerity of the environment. Furthermore, many of the strategies that are typically utilized by visitors to altitude may have implications from an anti-doping point of view.This position statement was commissioned and approved by the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine. The purpose of this statement was to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist clinicians with the preparation and management of athletes and individuals travelling to altitude for both competition and training.

      "(0.661)  Naturalistic theories of disease appeal to concepts of biological function, and use the notion of dysfunction as the basis of their definitions. Debates in the philosophy of biology demonstrate how attributing functions in organisms and establishing the function-dysfunction distinction is by no means straightforward. This problematization of functional ascription has undermined naturalistic theories and led some authors to abandon the concept of dysfunction, favoring instead definitions based in normative criteria or phenomenological approaches. Although this work has enhanced our understanding of disease and illness, we need not necessarily abandon naturalistic concepts of function and dysfunction in the disease debate. This article attempts to move towards a new naturalistic theory of disease that overcomes the limitations of previous definitions and offers advantages in the clinical setting. Our approach involves a re-evaluation of concepts of biological function employed by naturalistic theories. Drawing on recent insights from the philosophy of biology, we develop a contextual and evaluative account of function that is better suited to clinical medicine and remains consistent with contemporary naturalism. We also show how an updated naturalistic view shares important affinities with normativist and phenomenological positions, suggesting a possibility for consilience in the disease debate.\t\t\n",
      "(0.641)  A model for patient-centred nurse consulting, developed in the context of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, is reported in this article. The model was created in the absence of any existing model for nurse consulting. Heart disease clinics are increasingly being used to implement the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease and it is anticipated that this model will be of practical use to nurses running these clinics. The model consists of eight steps, broadly following the chronology of the consultation. Each step contains a question for the nurse to ask him/herself and a task to complete. The model was developed as part of a research project on the influence of customized computer software used on nurse consultations with patients with heart disease.\t\t\n",
      "(0.626)  Background: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome are common diseases which may be related. Aim: To examine the association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome in Chinese population in Hong Kong. Methods: Randomly selected ethnic Chinese were invited to participate in a telephone survey in 1996. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined as subjects having heartburn and/or acid regurgitation once weekly or more. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome I criteria. The association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome was calculated using a statistical model which allows the odds ratio to be measured. Results: One thousand six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate 62%). The population prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome were 5% and 4%, respectively. Thirteen per cent of subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and 11% with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The OR of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 3 (95% CI: 1.05, 6.27) indicating a positive association between the two diseases. This association occurred predominantly in male subjects [OR = 9.3, (95% CI: 2.3, 26.2)] but not as strong in females [OR = 1.5, (95% CI: 0.3, 4.3)]. Younger subjects were statistically more prone to the two diseases. Conclusions: There is a positive association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and their association occurs predominantly in male subjects. © 2007 The Authors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.624)  The change in hypometabolism affects the regional links in the brain network. Here, to understand the underlying brain metabolic network deficits during the early stage and disease evolution of AD (Alzheimer disease), we applied correlation analysis to identify the metabolic connectivity patterns using 18F-FDG PET data for NC (normal control), sMCI (stable MCI), pMCI (progressive MCI) and AD, and explore the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity between anatomically-defined brain regions. Regions extracted from 90 anatomical structures were used to construct the matrix for measuring the inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. The brain connectivity patterns from the metabolic network show a decreasing trend of inter- and intra-hemispheric connections for NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD. Connection of temporal to the frontal or occipital regions is a characteristic pattern for conversion of NC to MCI, and the density of links in the parietal-occipital network is a differential pattern between sMCI and pMCI. The reduction pattern of inter and intra-hemispheric brain connectivity in the metabolic network depends on the disease stages, and is with a decreasing trend with respect to disease severity. Both frontal-occipital and parietal-occipital connectivity patterns in the metabolic network using 18F-FDG PET are the key feature for differentiating disease groups in AD.\t\t\n",
      "(0.623)  Heart failure and coronary artery disease share many risk factors. Coronary artery disease often pre-dates the development of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A diagnosis of heart failure should be considered in any patient with a history of coronary artery disease who presents with breathlessness, ankle oedema or fatigue. Several therapies, such as renin-angiotensin antagonists and B blockers, have been proven to improve survival in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction but evidence for effectiveness in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is lacking. The management of heart failure and coronary artery disease overlaps considerably but can also be conflicting. Optimal risk factor management is key to preventing progression to heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease. Crown Copyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. \n",

Our aim was to systematically, but not exhaustively, examine applications of MM-GT and offer procedural guidelines. We identified 61 empirical MM-GT articles and developed a codebook for analysis. MM-GT was widely used across disciplines. Most published MM-GT provided little methodological detail regarding grounded theory, mixed methods, and their integration; theoretical development was noticeably absent; and the majority followed a convergent mixed methods design. This inquiry contributes to emerging discussions regarding the ways in which MM-GT can or should be used to more fully realize the potential of this approach.\t\t\n",

Knowing that the generation, analysis, and interpretation of empirical materials are processes always conducted within some understanding of what constitutes legitimate inquiry and valid knowledge, she drew inspiration from ethnographical, confessional, critical, and post-modern work to propose a set of dialogical principles for conducting and evaluating a nonfoundational type of research inquiry. This manuscript revisits this venture a number of years later, reflecting on what has changed and what is still missing. We argue that there is a space and an occasion in the research methods literature for proposing dialogical principles for nonfoundational research, principles that are particularly relevant for qualitative researchers struggling in business schools worldwide.\t\t\n",

Our view is that unless implementation is accompanied by intensive formative evaluation including local flexibility in the development, procurement and implementation process - it is likely that it will continue to fall short of its objectives in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The complexity and rapid pace of change in patterns of care delivery and advances in technology highlight the need for evolutionary procurement and implementation processes.

Methods: This work was carried out by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Equity and Stakeholder Engagement Project Groups through brainstorming and iterative frameworks, stakeholder engagement, pilot testing, refinement of ideas, using input from workshops, and discussions at GRADE Working Group meetings to produce this document, which constitutes a GRADE conceptual article on implementation. Results: We introduce the FACE implementation criteria, feasibility, acceptability, cost, and equity; priority; and intent to implement criterion. We outline the implementation importance of networks and approaches to patient and other stakeholder engagement. Implementation is often highly contextual and can benefit from stakeholder engagement and other assessments. Our FACE approach provides stakeholder questions and language to inform guideline implementation and tools. Conclusion: The FACE criteria propose a series of knowledge translation questions to guide the assessment of implementation for evidence-based guidelines. It is desirable for guideline developers to use a conceptual approach, such as FACE, to tailor implementation and inform end of guideline dissemination and knowledge translation activities. \n",

Methods: Adolescents from Minnesota participating in Project EAT (n = 2516) were surveyed in 1999 and 2004. Mixed-model regressions were used to assess secular and longitudinal changes in percentage reporting frequent fast food intake (= 3 times/week) and weekly fast food intake. Results: Between 1999 and 2004, a secular increase in the percent of adolescents of middle (high school-aged) adolescents reporting frequent fast food consumption was observed (females: 18.9% to 27.3%, p < .01, males: 23.6% to 30.2%, p = .06). Longitudinal increases in frequent fast food consumption were seen from early to middle adolescence (females: 15.8% to 27.3%, p < .01, males: 16.8% to 30.2%, p < .01), and among males, from middle to late adolescence (23.6% to 32.0%, p < .01). Conclusions: The secular increase in fast food consumption among middle adolescents suggests that socio-environmental changes between 1999 and 2004 may have contributed to adolescents' fast food intake, while the longitudinal trends indicate the importance of developmental influences on fast food intake. The transition from early to middle adolescence, and for males, from middle into late adolescence, are key periods during which efforts to reduce fast food consumption are needed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

      "(0.831)  An high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection was developed to quantify both 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and lycopene in plasma and breast nipple aspirate fluids (NAF). As an example of the utility of this assay, levels in plasma and NAF of 11 women were examined and compared with levels of 8-isoprostane, a commonly used marker of lipid oxidation. Levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and 8-isoprostane were higher in NAF than in plasma, but levels of lycopene were lower in NAF than in plasma. Levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol in plasma and in NAF were significantly correlated with both lycopene and 8-isoprostane levels. This is consistent with the dependence of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol levels on both dietary intakes of lycopene and oxidative stress levels. For the correlations between NAF and plasma, lycopene levels were significantly correlated, whereas 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol levels were not, indicating that levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol in NAF are difficult to predict from plasma levels. The high levels of 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol and 8-isoprostane in NAF are consistent with high levels of oxidative stress in the breast.\t\t\n",

      "(0.785)  Background: Dietary factors such as folate, vitamin B12, protein, and methionine are important for the excretion of arsenic via one-carbon metabolism in undernourished populations exposed to high levels of arsenic via drinking water. However, the effects of dietary factors on toenail arsenic concentrations in well-nourished populations exposed to relatively low levels of water arsenic are unknown. Methods: As part of a population-based case-control study of skin and bladder cancer from the USA, we evaluated relationships between consumption of dietary factors and arsenic concentrations in toenail clippings. Consumption of each dietary factor was determined from a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used general linear models to examine the associations between toenail arsenic and each dietary factor, taking into account potentially confounding effects. Results: As expected, we found an inverse association between ln-transformed toenail arsenic and consumption of vitamin B12 (excluding supplements) and animal protein. Unexpectedly, there were also inverse associations with numerous dietary lipids (e.g., total fat, total animal fat, total vegetable fat, total monounsaturated fat, total polyunsaturated fat, and total saturated fat). Finally, increased toenail arsenic concentrations were associated with increased consumption of long chain n-3 fatty acids. Conclusion: In a relatively well-nourished population exposed to relatively low levels of arsenic via water, consumption of certain dietary lipids may decrease toenail arsenic concentration, while long chain n-3 fatty acids may increase toenail arsenic concentration, possibly due to their association with arsenolipids in fish tissue. © 2012 Gruber et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\t\t\n",

We selected children 2- to 18-y-old (n = 31,337) from 4 nationally representative surveys of food intake between 1977-1978 and 2003-2006. We assessed portion sizes (kcal and g) of selected key foods (soft/fruit drinks, salty snacks, desserts, French fries, burgers, pizzas, Mexican fast foods, and hot dogs), the total energy from eating occasions that included key foods, and portion sizes of the selected key foods by source (stores, restaurants, and fast-food locations). These foods represented over one-third of children's energy intake in 2003-2006. Portion sizes increased significantly over the 30-y period and increases in pizza were particularly pronounced in the last decade [+176 kcal (736 kJ). Energy from eating occasions including pizzas and soft drinks increased, as did the proportion of energy from these foods in an eating occasion. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers increased in portion size and eating occasion size, but the proportion of these foods in the total eating occasions did not increase. Portion sizes of other key foods increased, although the total energy from eating events that included them remained constant (e.g. Mexican fast-foods, French fries, fruit drinks) or decreased (e.g. salty snacks, desserts). Portion sizes increased across all food sources (stores, restaurants, and fast foods) for soft drinks and pizzas but only at fast-food locations for French fries. Portion sizes continue to grow for selected foods. Fast-food chains appear to be linked with less healthful portion size increases for selected foods. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition. \n",

Advanced imaging tools such as high-resolution (HR) peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) provide the opportunity to investigate how components of bone microstructure differ between the sexes and across developmental periods. The aim of this study was to quantify the age- and sex-related differences in bone microstructure and bone strength in adolescent males and females. We used HR-pQCT (XtremeCT, Scanco Medical, Geneva, Switzerland) to assess total bone area (ToA), total bone density (ToD), trabecular bone density (TrD), cortical bone density (CoD), cortical thickness (Cort.Th), trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), trabecular spacing standard deviation (Tb.Sp SD), and bone strength index (BSI, mg2/mm4) at the distal tibia in 133 females and 146 males (15 to 20 years of age). We used a general linear model to determine differences by age- and sex-group and age x sex interactions (p<0.05). Across age categories, ToD, CoD, Cort.Th, and BSI were significantly lower at 15 and 16 years compared with 17 to 18 and 19 to 20 years in males and females. There were no differences in ToA, TrD, and BV/TV across age for either sex. Between sexes, males had significantly greater ToA, TrD, Cort.Th, BV/TV, Tb.N, and BSI compared with females; CoD and Tb.Sp SD were significantly greater for females in every age category. Males' larger and denser bones confer a bone-strength advantage from a young age compared with females. These structural differences could represent bones that are less able to withstand loads in compression in females. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\t\t\n",
      "(0.589)  This article examined emotion competence in children exposed to domestic violence (DV). It also examined the hypothesis that children's emotional competence mediates relations between DV and children's later difficulties with peers and behavioral adjustment. DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of DV on children's emotional development and the role that different aspects of emotional competence play in children's socio-emotional adjustment. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2007.\t\t\n",

Among populations with ideal PA (= 150 min/week; ranging from 56% (non-Hispanic black females) to 88% (non-Hispanic white males) at age 20), NTPs to intermediate PA (> 0<149 min/week) generally increased with age, particularly for non-Hispanic black females for whom a net 0.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 0.2) transitioned from ideal to intermediate PA at age 20; by age 70, the NTP rose to 3.6% (95% CI: 2.3, 4.8). Heterogeneity in intermediate to poor (0 min/week) PA NTPs also was observed, with NTPs peaking at age 20 for Hispanic/Latino males and females [age 20 NTP = 3.7% (95% CI: 2.0, 5.5) for females and 5.0% (1.2, 8.7) for males], but increasing throughout adulthood for non-Hispanic blacks and whites [e.g. age 70 NTP = 7.8% (95% CI: 6.1, 9.6%) for black females and 8.1% (4.7, 11.6) for black males]. Demographic differences in PA net transitions across adulthood justify further development of tailored interventions. However, innovative efforts may be required for populations in which large proportions have already transitioned from ideal PA by early adulthood.\t\t\n",
      "(0.507)  Background: Menopause timing is related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Lead has been associated with an earlier age at menopause, but no study has considered exposure to other metals or multiple metals simultaneously. Methods: At baseline, we measured toenail concentrations of 16 metals for 903 premenopausal women in the Sister Study (2003-2009). Age at menopause was ascertained through follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between individual metals and age at menopause. We used quantile-g-computation to examine the association between age at menopause and the joint effect of a simultaneous increase in (1) all metals and for subgroups of metals categorized as (2) essential or (3) non-essential. Results: For individual metals, we observed negligible associations except for an interquartile range increase in lead which was modestly associated with an earlier age at menopause (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05). In the mixture analyses, a quartile increase in all metals was associated with a later age at menopause (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.02). The metals with the largest negative contributions (i.e., associated with a later age at menopause) were chromium and nickel. The joint effect for the essential metals remained inverse (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.64, 1.07), but was attenuated for nonessential metals (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76, 1.24). Conclusions: Although no individual metal was strongly associated with age at menopause, our joint effect analysis suggests that having low levels of essential metals could be associated with an earlier age at menopause. \n",

      "(0.508)  Background: Balloon ablation catheters using various energy sources are being developed to perform pulmonary vein (PV) isolation to treat atrial fibrillation. Prior evaluations of 2D CT/MR images are limited by the frequent elliptical shape of the PV ostia, the nonorthogonal orientation of the PVs to the left atrial (LA) chamber, and difficulty in appreciating through-slice curvature. To provide anatomical data relevant to balloon catheter ablation, 3D surface reconstructions of LA-PVs were generated and analyzed to define ostial architecture and size. Methods and Results: Using MRI datasets obtained from 101 paroxysmal AF patients, the LA-PVs were segmented to generate 3D LA-PV surface reconstructions. Using both external and endoluminal projections, the PV ostial and antral regions were identified and evaluated. In the left PVs, a common left-sided ostium was identified in 94 patients, with an ostial circumference of 95 ± 15 mm. Branching of the left PVs occurred 0-5 mm away from the common left ostium in 43 patients (43%), 5-15 mm away from the common os in 37 patients (37%), and >15 mm away from the common os in 14 patients (14%). In patients with either distinct left PV ostia, or common os <15 mm (87 patients), the individual LSPV/LIPV ostial circumferences were 67 ± 12 mm and 58 ± 9 mm, respectively. Mean left antral circumference was 114 ± 17 mm. In the right PVs, the ostial circumferences of the RSPV/RIPV were 68 ± 11 mm and 66 ± 11 mm, respectively. Mean right antral circumference was 107 ± 19 mm. Assuming ideal deformation of the LA chamber anatomy, the minimal diameters of a balloon ablation catheter required to isolate 95% of the RSPV, RIPV, LSPV, LIPV, LCPV, left antrum, and right antrum are 29 mm, 28 mm, 29 mm, 24 mm, 40 mm, 46 mm, and 47 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Analysis of 3D surface reconstructions of LA-PV anatomy reveals that balloon catheter-based ablation of the PVs is likely feasible in most patients, but balloon ablation of the common PV antra would be problematic.\t\t\n",
      "(0.484)  In some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and bilateral STN-DBS the motor benefit from one STN alone appears similar to the improvement obtained with bilateral STN-DBS. Thus, we hypothesized that some patients have a \"dominant-STN,\" whose stimulation achieves similar results than bilateral stimulation.Twenty-two consecutive PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS were assessed in 4 randomized conditions: bilateral off-stimulation, bilateral on-stimulation, unilateral right- and unilateral left-stimulation. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of the motor UPDRS scores in these 4 conditions showed that 11 patients (50%) presented with a \"dominant-STN.\" Interestingly, in 3 of these patients the dominant-STN was ipsilateral to the most affected side of the body. Our results support the presence of different phenotypes of response to bilateral STN stimulation. In our sample 50% of the patients presented with a dominant-STN, suggesting that a non-negligible part of PD patients might not need bilateral STN-DBS surgery. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.\t\t\n",
      "(0.42)  Background: The following study presents in detail newly occurring changes in driving ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Patients and methods: The caregivers of 30 patients with FTLD (20 with FTD, 10 with SD) and 26 matched patients with AD were interviewed on potential alterations in driving ability using a standardized questionnaire. Results: Of the patients 90% with FTLD and 58% with AD showed changes in driving behavior. In AD the predominating alteration was an unsteady style of driving with increased lack of orientation. Patients with FTLD presented an aggressive and risky style of driving including various traffic rule violations. Significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding speeding, disregarding red traffic lights, inappropriate behavior and driving despite being forbidden by the family Of the patients with FTLD 37% were responsible for at least one accident since disease onset in comparison to 19% of patients with AD (p=0.24). Most patients with AD showed a reasonable attitude to their change in driving behavior, however the majority of patients with FTLD showed a lack of understanding for the fact that their style of driving presented a potential risk and did not accept the need to stop driving (p=0.023). Conclusion: Patients with FTLD should cease driving as soon as possible in the course of the disease. With patients suffering from mild AD an individual assessment should be made. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.\t\t\n",
      "(0.407)  The impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis, taking into account other comorbidities, is not clear. We studied the overall mortality in CRC patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-IBD-CRC patients. Data on all CRC and IBD patients diagnosed with CRC between 1977 and 2009 were retrieved from Danish medical registries. One-year and 5-year overall mortality were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and with Cox regression, adjusting for year of CRC diagnosis, sex, Duke's stage, age at CRC diagnosis, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. We identified 653 CRC patients diagnosed with UC, 238 patients with CD, and 107,024 CRC patients without IBD. The patients with IBD were younger at diagnosis than patients without IBD. The Duke's stage distribution was similar for UC-CRC patients and non-IBD-CRC patients. The CD-CRC patients had a lower frequency of Duke's A and B stage tumors (36% versus 42%), a higher frequency of Duke's C stage tumors (31% versus 27%) and Duke's D-stage tumors (23% versus 21%), and a similar frequency of unknown stage tumors (10%) compared with non-IBD-CRC patients. After 5-years of follow-up, 59% of the UC and the non-UC-CRC patients had died compared with 62% of the patients with CD and 56% of the non-CD-CRC patients. The 5-year adjusted mortality rate ratios for patients with UC or CD were 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.27) and 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.49), respectively, compared with patients without IBD. A history of IBD in patients with CRC may be associated with increased mortality.\t\t\n",
      "(0.406)  Purpose: Evidence suggests anti-estrogen endocrine therapy (ET) is associated with adverse cognitive effects; however, findings are based on small samples and vary in the cognitive abilities affected. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. Methods: Electronic databases were searched in November 2016. Fourteen studies totaling 911 BC patients on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or tamoxifen (TAM) and 911 controls (i.e., non-cancer controls and BC controls not using ET) were included. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into six domains. Effect sizes were computed to compare (1) ET patients versus controls and (2) TAM patients versus AI patients. Results: In cross-sectional comparisons, ET patients performed worse than control groups on verbal learning/memory, visual learning/memory, frontal executive function, and processing speed, but did not differ on psychomotor efficiency or visuospatial function. Subgroup analyses revealed that verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls. In other domains, ET patients and BC controls performed equivalently. Regarding change from pre-treatment performance, ET patients did not differ from controls on any domain. TAM and AI patients did not from one another differ overall; however, subgroup analyses indicated that TAM patients performed better than non-steroidal AI patients on several domains, but showed few performance differences relative to steroidal AI patients. Conclusions: Verbal learning/memory was the only domain where ET patients performed worse than both non-cancer and BC controls, suggesting specific adverse effects on this domain. Additional studies assessing change from pre-treatment performance and differences between steroidal and non-steroidal AIs are warranted. \n",

      "(0.63)  Even the highest quality evidence will have little impact unless it is incorporated into decision-making for health. It is therefore critical to overcome the many barriers to using evidence in decision-making, including (1) missing the window of opportunity, (2) knowledge gaps and uncertainty, (3) controversy, irrelevant and conflicting evidence, as well as (4) vested interests and conflicts of interest. While this is certainly not a comprehensive list, it covers a number of main themes discussed in the knowledge translation literature on this topic, and better understanding these barriers can help readers of the evidence to be more savvy knowledge users and help researchers overcome challenges to getting their evidence into practice. Thus, the first step in being able to use research evidence for improving population health is ensuring that the evidence is available at the right time and in the right format and language so that knowledge users can take the evidence into consideration alongside a multitude of other factors that also influence decision-making. The sheer volume of scientific publications makes it difficult to find the evidence that can actually help inform decisions for health. Policymakers, especially in low- and middle-income countries, require context-specific evidence to ensure local relevance. Knowledge synthesis and dissemination of policy-relevant local evidence is important, but it is still not enough. There are times when the interpretation of the evidence leads to various controversies and disagreements, which act as barriers to the uptake of evidence. Research evidence can also be influenced and misused for various aims and agendas. It is therefore important to ensure that any new evidence comes from reliable sources and is interpreted in light of the overall body of scientific literature. It is not enough to simply produce evidence, nor even to synthesize and package evidence into a more user-friendly format. Particularly at the policy level, political savvy is also needed to ensure that vested interests do not undermine decisions that can impact the health of individuals and populations.\t\t\n",
      "(0.558)  Evidence-based decision-making is centred on the justification of decisions. In the shift from an individual-clinical to a population-policy level, the decision-making context becomes more uncertain, variable and complex. To address this we have developed a conceptual framework for evidence-based decision-making, focusing on how context impacts on what constitutes evidence and how that evidence is utilised. We present two distinct orientations towards what constitutes evidence, representing different relationships between evidence and context. We also categorise the decision-making context based on the ways in which context impacts on evidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, we invoke the concept of axes of evidence-based decision-making to describe the relationship between evidence and context as we move from evidence-based medicine to evidence-based health policy. From this, we suggest that it may be more important how evidence is utilised than how it is defined. Based on the research and knowledge utilisation literature, we present a process model of evidence utilisation, which forms the basis for the conceptual framework for context-based evidence-based decision-making. The conceptual framework attempts to capture the role that context plays in the introduction, interpretation and application of evidence. We illustrate this framework with examples from policy development for colorectal cancer screening. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\t\t\n",
      "(0.545)  Evidence-based approaches are assuming prominence in many health-care fields. The core ideas of evidence-based health care derive from clinical epidemiology and general internal medicine. The concept of evidence has yet to be analysed systematically; what counts as evidence may vary across disciplines. Furthermore, the contribution of the social sciences, particularly qualitative methodology, has received scant attention. This paper outlines a model of evidence that describes four distinct but related types of evidence: qualitative-personal; qualitative-general; quantitative-general and quantitative-personal. The rationale for these distinctions and the implications of these for a theory of evidence are discussed.\t\t\n",
      "(0.518)  Making decisions on the basis of evidence is a central tenet of all health-care disciplines, including public health. However, it is not entirely clear what it means to base decisions on evidence; debates on evidence-based approaches often lack a clear understanding of the nature of evidence and obscure the normative underpinnings of evidence. Public health decision making requires an acceptance of limitations such as the availability of funding for research to provide complete evidence for any given decision, the ethical constraints on the creation of certain types of evidence and the ongoing dilemma between the need to take action and the need to gather more information. Using the example of the SARS outbreak in Canada, the inter-relationships between evidence and ethics are explored. I outline a set of critical questions for the global public health community to discuss regarding the nature of the relationship between evidence-based public health practice and ethics.\t\t\n",
      "(0.473)  To review existing evidence on the potential of incentives to undermine or \"crowd out\" intrinsic motivation, in order to establish whether and when it predicts financial incentives to crowd out motivation for health-related behaviors. Method: We conducted a conceptual analysis to compare definitions and operationalizations of the effect, and reviewed existing evidence to identify potential moderators of the effect. Results: In the psychological literature, we find strong evidence for an undermining effect of tangible rewards on intrinsic motivation for simple tasks when motivation manifest in behavior is initially high. In the economic literature, evidence for undermining effects exists for a broader variety of behaviors, in settings that involve a conflict of interest between parties. By contrast, for health related behaviors, baseline levels of incentivized behaviors are usually low, and only a subset involve an interpersonal conflict of interest. Correspondingly, we find no evidence for crowding out of incentivized health behaviors. Conclusion: The existing evidence does not warrant a priori predictions that an undermining effect would be found for health-related behaviors. Health-related behaviors and incentives schemes differ greatly in moderating characteristics, which should be the focus of future research. © 2013 American Psychological Association. \n",

In this article, we explore different approaches to clinical judgement articulated in the literature, focusing in particular on data-driven, mathematical approaches which we contrast with narrative, virtue-based approaches to clinical reasoning. We discuss the tension between these different clinical epistemologies and further explore the implications of big data and machine learning for a philosophy of clinical judgement. We argue for a pluralistic, integrative approach, and demonstrate how narrative, virtue-based clinical reasoning will remain indispensable in an era of big data and predictive analytics.\t\t\n",
      "(0.604)  Introduction Emergency medicine (EM) has a high case turnover and acuity making it a demanding clinical reasoning domain especially for junior doctors who lack experience. We aimed to better understand their clinical reasoning using dual cognition as a guiding theory. Methods EM junior doctors were recruited from six hospitals in the south of England to participate in semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus groups (n=17) based on recall of two recent cases. Transcripts were analysed using a grounded theory approach to identify themes and to develop a model of junior doctors' clinical reasoning in EM. Results Within cases, clinical reasoning occurred in three phases. In phase 1 (case framing), initial case cues and first impressions were predominantly intuitive, but checked by analytical thought and determined the urgency of clinical assessment. In phase 2 (evolving reasoning), non-analytical single cue and pattern recognitions were common which were subsequently validated by specific analytical strategies such as use of red flags. In phase 3 (ongoing uncertainty) analytical self-monitoring and reassurance strategies were used to precipitate a decision regarding discharge. Conclusion We found a constant dialectic between intuitive and analytical cognition throughout the reasoning process. Our model of clinical reasoning by EM junior doctors illustrates the specific contextual manifestations of the dual cognition theory. Distinct diagnostic strategies are identified and together these give EM learners and educators a framework and vocabulary for discussion and learning about clinical reasoning.\t\t\n",

Experts were selected from different fields and organized into five Focus Groups. A questionnaire was developed and sent to experts in the area of frailty. Responses and comments were analyzed using a pre-established strategy. Statements with an agreement more than or equal to 80% were accepted.Results.Overall, 44% of the statements regarding the concept of frailty and 18% of the statements regarding diagnostic criteria were accepted. There was consensus on the value of screening for frailty and about the identification of six domains of frailty for inclusion in a clinical definition, but no agreement was reached concerning a specific set of clinical/laboratory biomarkers useful for diagnosis.Conclusions.There is agreement on the usefulness of defining frailty in clinical settings as well as on its main dimensions. However, additional research is needed before an operative definition of frailty can be established. © 2012 The Author.\t\t\n",

      "(0.525)  Physicians function as clinicians, teachers, and role models within the clinical environment. Negative learning environments have been shown to be due to many factors, including the presence of unprofessional behaviors among clinical teachers. Reliable and valid assessments of clinical teacher performance, including professional behaviors, may provide a foundation for evidence-based feedback to clinical teachers, enable targeted remediation or recognition, and help to improve the learning environment. However, few tools exist for the evaluation of clinical teachers that include a focus on both professional and clinical teaching behaviors. The Professionalism Assessment of Clinical Teachers (PACT) was developed and implemented at one Canadian institution and was assessed for evidence of reliability and validity. Following each clerkship rotation, students in the 2009-2010 third-year undergraduate clerkship cohort (n = 178) anonymously evaluated a minimum of two clinical teachers using the PACT. 4,715 forms on 567 faculty members were completed. Reliability, validity, and free text comments (present in 45 % of the forms) were examined. An average of 8.6 PACT forms were completed per faculty (range 1-60), with a reliability of 0.31 for 2.9 forms (harmonic mean); 12 forms were necessary for a reliability of 0.65. Global evaluations of teachers aligned with ratings of free-text comments (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). Comment length related negatively with overall rating (r = -0.19, p < 0.001). Mean performance related negatively with variability of performance (r = -0.72, p < 0.001), although this may be related to a ceiling effect. Most faculty members were rated highly; however 'provided constructive feedback' was the least well-rated item. Respectful interactions with students appeared to be the most influential item in the global rating of faculty performance. The PACT is a moderately reliable tool for the assessment of professional behaviors of clinical teachers, with evidence supporting its validity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. \n",

      "(0.679)  Background: The Health Economics Research Centre (HERC) Database of Mapping Studies was established in 2013, based on a systematic review of studies developing mapping algorithms predicting EQ-5D. The Mapping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards (MAPS) statement was published in 2015 to improve reporting of mapping studies. We aimed to update the systematic review and assess the extent to which recently-published studies mapping condition-specific quality of life or clinical measures to the EQ-5D follow the guidelines published in the MAPS Reporting Statement. Methods: A published systematic review was updated using the original inclusion criteria to include studies published by December 2016. We included studies reporting novel algorithms mapping from any clinical measure or patient-reported quality of life measure to either the EQ-5D-3L or EQ-5D-5L. Titles and abstracts of all identified studies and the full text of papers published in 2016 were assessed against the MAPS checklist. Results: The systematic review identified 144 mapping studies reporting 190 algorithms mapping from 110 different source instruments to EQ-5D. Of the 17 studies published in 2016, nine (53%) had titles that followed the MAPS statement guidance, although only two (12%) had abstracts that fully addressed all MAPS items. When the full text of these papers was assessed against the complete MAPS checklist, only two studies (12%) were found to fulfil or partly fulfil all criteria. Of the 141 papers (across all years) that included abstracts, the items on the MAPS statement checklist that were fulfilled by the largest number of studies comprised having a structured abstract (95%) and describing target instruments (91%) and source instruments (88%). Conclusions: The number of published mapping studies continues to increase. Our updated database provides a convenient way to identify mapping studies for use in cost-utility analysis. Most recent studies do not fully address all items on the MAPS checklist.\t\t\n",

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandates that calorie labels be added to menu boards of chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. This systematic review includes seven studies published since the last review on the topic in 2008. Authors searched for peer-reviewed studies using PUBMED and Google Scholar. Included studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design comparing a calorie-labeled menu with a no-calorie menu and were conducted in laboratories, college cafeterias, and fast food restaurants. Two of the included studies were judged to be of good quality, and five of were judged to be of fair quality. Observational studies conducted in cities after implementation of calorie labeling were imprecise in their measure of the isolated effects of calorie labels. Experimental studies conducted in laboratory settings were difficult to generalize to real world behavior. Only two of the seven studies reported a statistically significant reduction in calories purchased among consumers using calorie-labeled menus. The current evidence suggests that calorie labeling does not have the intended effect of decreasing calorie purchasing or consumption. © 2011 Swartz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\t\t\n",
      "(0.518)  Mixed studies reviews include empirical studies with diverse designs (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods). To make the process of identifying relevant empirical studies for such reviews more efficient, we developed a mixed filter that included different keywords and subject headings for quantitative (e.g., cohort study), qualitative (e.g., focus group), and mixed methods studies. It was tested for six journals from three disciplines. We measured precision (proportion of retrieved documents being relevant), sensitivity (proportion of relevant documents retrieved), and specificity (proportion of non-relevant documents not retrieved). Records were coded before applying the filter and compared with retrieved records, and descriptive statistics were performed, suggesting the mixed filter has high sensitivity, but lower precision and specificity (close to 50%). Next, based on the success of the filter, we developed an automated text classification system that can automatically select empirical studies in order to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews. Several algorithms were trained and validated with 8,050 database records that were previously manually categorized. Decision trees had the best results and surpassed the accuracy of the filter by 30% when using full-text documents. This algorithm was then adapted into an online format that can be used by researchers to analyze their bibliography and categorize records into 'empirical' and 'nonempirical'. \n",

Results: Socioeconomic factors beyond income and parental education (eg, wealth) were associated with some health behaviors depending upon gender. However, we did not find that a wider range of factors helped us better understand racial/ethnic disparities.

      "(0.47)  Aim: To describe the avoidable factors associated with child deaths identified by a confidential enquiry. Method: In the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries confidential enquiry, a sample (13%) of cases was subjected to case note review by multidisciplinary panels attempting to identify avoidable factors associated with the deaths. Cases were selected blindly but in equal numbers from predetermined age bands and participating regions. The anonymised records were reviewed in regions remote to where the child lived and died. Panel composition, conduct and reporting were standardised. Results: 119 of 126 cases reviewed by enquiry panels had sufficient information to determine avoidable factors. These cases were comparable with the whole dataset in terms of sex and causes of death. 31 (26%) of 119 had avoidable factors that were predominantly related to individuals or agencies with a direct responsibility to the child. 51 (43%) of 119 were defined as potentially avoidable. In all, 130 factors were considered in relation to these 82 cases, and 64% of the factors were healthcare related. Avoidable factors were more likely where life-limiting illness was not present. Recurring avoidable factors included failure to recognise serious illness at the point of presentation and death occurring in children who had been lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Child Death Overview Panels now have the responsibility to review child deaths using similar methods but relying upon data forms rather than the case record. Analysis of contributory factors on a national scale has the potential to improve understanding of why children die and indicate strategies to reduce child mortality.\t\t\n",

Although the research identified some factors specific to the experiences of students on the particular programme, this article focuses on findings and recommendations of generic interest. The article compares data from semi-structured interviews with two groups of students: students who had withdrawn without completing their programme and students who considered leaving, but chose to stay. The article suggests that, in most cases, decisions to leave cannot be reduced to single factors, but are the culmination of complex interacting factors. Six 'push' factors are explored. These factors were mentioned by both groups of students. The article also discusses four 'pull' factors which act to hold students on their courses. Recommendations for improving retention include increasing support for students, and adapting provision to meet the needs of a diverse student population. Copyright © 2007 SAGE Publications.\t\t\n",
      "(0.424)  Many factors affect child and adolescent mortality in high-income countries. These factors can be conceptualised within four domains-intrinsic (biological and psychological) factors, the physical environment, the social environment, and service delivery. The most prominent factors are socioeconomic gradients, although the mechanisms through which they exert their eff ects are complex, affect all four domains, and are often poorly understood. Although some contributing factors are relatively fi xed-including a child's sex, age, ethnic origin, and genetics, some parental characteristics, and environmental conditions-others might be amenable to interventions that could lessen risks and help to prevent future child deaths. We give several examples of health service features that could affect child survival, along with interventions, such as changes to the physical or social environment, which could affect upstream (distal) factors.\t\t\n",
      "(0.421)  This article seeks to answer the question, \"What factors characterize highly productive educational psychologists?\" Using qualitative research methods, we identified three top scholars in educational psychology - Richard Anderson, Richard Mayer, and Michael Pressley - and examined factors that influence their work. Although each scholar had a distinctive trademark characteristic, they had much in common. Each had an impressive lineage, gravitated to centers of excellence, was guided by routine, contributed significantly to educational service, pursued outside interests, strived for clarity in writing, collaborated heavily and effectively with students, and shared the same guiding philosophy regarding scholarly productivity. The article concludes with advice to budding educational psychologists and with unanswered questions that perhaps merit further research. \n",
